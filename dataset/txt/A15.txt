The ABCs of Hepatitis – for Health Professionals

HEPATITIS A is caused 

by the hepatitis A virus (HAV)

HEPATITIS B is caused by the hepatitis B 

virus (HBV)

HEPATITIS C is caused by 

the hepatitis C virus (HCV)

U.S. Statistics

•  Estimated 24,900 new 

infections in 2018

•  Estimated 21,600 new infections in 2018

•  Estimated 862,000 people living with chronic 

HBV infection in 2016 

•  Estimated 50,300 new infections 

in 2018

•  Estimated 2.4 million people living 

with HCV infection in 2016

Routes of 

Transmission

Fecal-oral route.

HAV is transmitted through: 

•  Close person-to-person contact 

with an infected person

•  Sexual contact with an infected 

person

•  Ingestion of contaminated food 

or water

Although viremia occurs early in 

infection, bloodborne transmission 

of HAV is uncommon.

Percutaneous, mucosal, or nonintact skin 

exposure to infectious blood, semen, and other 

body fluids. HBV is concentrated most highly in 

blood, and percutaneous exposure is an efficient 

mode of transmission. 

HBV is transmitted primarily through:

•  Birth to an infected mother 

•  Sexual contact with an infected person

•  Sharing contaminated needles, syringes, or 

other injection-drug equipment

Less commonly through:

•  Needle-sticks or other sharp instrument injuries

• Organ transplantation and dialysis

•  Interpersonal contact through sharing items 

such as razors or toothbrushes or contact with 

open sores of an infected person

Direct percutaneous exposure to 

infectious blood. Mucous membrane 

exposures to blood can also result in 

transmission, although this route is 

less efficient.

HCV is transmitted primarily through:

•  Sharing contaminated needles, 

syringes, or other equipment to 

inject drugs 

Less commonly through:

•  Birth to an infected mother

•  Sexual contact with an infected 

person

•  Unregulated tattooing

•  Needle-sticks or other sharp 

instrument injuries

Incubation Period

15–50 days 

(average: 28 days)

60–150 days 

(average: 90 days)

14–182 days 

(average range: 14–84 days)

Symptoms of 

Acute Infection

Symptoms of all types of viral hepatitis are similar and can include one or more of the following: 

• Jaundice    • Fever    • Fatigue    • Loss of appetite    • Nausea    • Vomiting    • Abdominal pain    • Joint pain

• Dark Urine    • Clay-colored stool    • Diarrhea (HAV only) 

Likelihood of 

Symptomatic 

Acute Infection

•  &lt;30% of children &lt;6 years  

of age have symptoms  

(which typically do not include 

jaundice)

•  &gt;70% of older children and 

adults have jaundice

•  Most children &lt;5 years of age do not have 

symptoms

•  30%–50% of people ≥5 years of age develop 

symptoms

•  Newly infected immunosuppressed adults 

generally do not have symptoms

•  Jaundice might occur in 20%–30% 

of people

•  Nonspecific symptoms (e.g., 

anorexia, malaise, or abdominal 

pain) might be present in 

10%–20% of people

Potential for 

Chronic Infection 

after Acute 

Infection

None

Chronic infection develops in:

•  90% of infants after acute infection at birth

•  25%–50% of children newly infected at ages 

1–5 years 

•  5% of people newly infected as adults

Chronic infection develops in over 

50% of newly infected people

HEPATITIS A

HEPATITIS B

HEPATITIS C

Severity

•  Most people with acute disease 

recover with no lasting liver 

damage; death is uncommon 

but occurs more often among 

older people and/or those with 

underlying liver disease

•  Most people with acute disease recover with no 

lasting liver damage; acute illness is rarely fatal 

•  15%–25% of people with chronic infection 

develop chronic liver disease, including 

cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer

•  Approximately 5%–25% of persons 

with chronic hepatitis C will 

develop cirrhosis over 10–20 years

•  People with hepatitis C and 

cirrhosis have a 1%–4% annual 

risk for hepatocellular carcinoma

Serologic Tests for 

Acute Infection

• IgM anti-HAV

• HBsAg, plus 

• IgM anti-HBc

•  No serologic marker for acute 

infection

Serologic Tests for 

Chronic Infection

•  Not applicable—no chronic 

infection

Tests for chronic infection should include three 

HBV seromarkers:

• HBsAg 

• anti-HBs 

• Total anti-HBc

•  Assay for anti-HCV

•  Qualitative and quantitative nucleic 

acid tests (NAT) to detect and 

quantify presence of virus (HCV 

RNA)

Testing 

Recommendations 

for Chronic 

Infection

•  Not applicable—no chronic 

infection

Note: testing for past acute 

infection is generally not 

recommended

•  All pregnant women should be tested for HBsAg 

during an early prenatal visit in each pregnancy 

•  Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers (HBsAg 

and anti-HBs are only recommended)

•  People born in regions with intermediate and 

high HBV endemicity (HBsAg prevalence ≥2%)

•  People born in U.S. not vaccinated as infants 

whose parents were born in regions with high 

HBV endemicity (≥8%)

•  Household or sexual contacts of people who are 

HBsAg-positive 

• Men who have sex with men
