Updated CDC Recommendations for the Management of Hepatitis B 

Virus–Infected Health-Care Providers and Students

Summary 

This report updates the 1991 CDC recommendations for the management of hepatitis B virus (HBV)–infected health-care 

providers and students to reduce risk for transmitting HBV to patients during the conduct of exposure-prone invasive procedures 

(CDC. Recommendations for preventing transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus to patients during 

exposure-prone invasive procedures. MMWR 1991;40[No. RR-8]). This update reflects changes in the epidemiology of HBV 

infection in the United States and advances in the medical management of chronic HBV infection and policy directives issued by 

health authorities since 1991. 

The primary goal of this report is to promote patient safety while providing risk management and practice guidance to HBV-

infected health-care providers and students, particularly those performing exposure-prone procedures such as certain types of surgery. 

Because percutaneous injuries sustained by health-care personnel during certain surgical, obstetrical, and dental procedures provide 

a potential route of HBV transmission to patients as well as providers, this report emphasizes prevention of operator injuries and 

blood exposures during exposure-prone surgical, obstetrical, and dental procedures. 

These updated recommendations reaffirm the 1991 CDC recommendation that HBV infection alone should not disqualify 

infected persons from the practice or study of surgery, dentistry, medicine, or allied health fields. The previous recommendations have 

been updated to include the following changes: no prenotification of patients of a health-care provider’s or student’s HBV status; use 

of HBV DNA serum levels rather than hepatitis B e-antigen status to monitor infectivity; and, for those health-care professionals 

requiring oversight, specific suggestions for composition of expert review panels and threshold value of serum HBV DNA considered 

“safe” for practice (<1,000 IU/ml). These recommendations also explicitly address the issue of medical and dental students who 

are discovered to have chronic HBV infection. For most chronically HBV-infected providers and students who conform to current 

standards for infection control, HBV infection status alone does not require any curtailing of their practices or supervised learning 

experiences. These updated recommendations outline the criteria for safe clinical practice of HBV-infected providers and students 

that can be used by the appropriate occupational or student health authorities to develop their own institutional policies. These 

recommendations also can be used by an institutional expert panel that monitors providers who perform exposure-prone procedures. 

Introduction 

In 1991, CDC published recommendations to prevent 

transmission of bloodborne viruses from infected health-care 

providers to patients while conducting exposure-prone invasive 

procedures (1). These recommendations did not prohibit the 

continued practice of invasive surgical techniques by HBV-

infected surgeons, dentists, and others, provided that the nature 

of their illnesses and their practices are reviewed and overseen 

by expert review panels. Essential elements of the 1991 CDC 

recommendations relevant to HBV included that 1) there be 

no restriction of activities for any health-care provider who does 

not perform invasive (exposure-prone) procedures; 2) exposure-

prone procedures should be defined by the medical/surgical/

dental organizations and institutions at which the procedures 

are performed; 3) providers who perform exposure-prone 

procedures and who do not have serologic evidence of immunity 

to HBV from vaccination should know their HBsAg status and, 

if that is positive, also should know their hepatitis B e-antigen 

(HBeAg) status; and 4) providers who are infected with HBV 

(and are HBeAg-positive) should seek counsel from and perform 

procedures under the guidance of an expert review panel (1). 

The 1991 recommendations also recommended that an 

HBV-infected health-care provider who performed exposure-

prone procedures, broadly defined, should notify patients 

in advance regarding the provider’s seropositivity. However, 

scientific data and clinical experience accumulated since 1991 

demonstrate that the risk for HBV and other bloodborne virus 

transmission from providers in health-care settings is extremely 

low. In addition, improvements in infection control practices 

put into effect since 1991 have enhanced both health-care 

provider and patient protection from exposure to blood and 

bloodborne viruses in health-care settings. 

This report is intended to guide the practices of chronically 

HBV-infected providers and students and the institutions that 

employ, oversee, or train them; it does not address those with 

acute HBV infection. This report is limited to the provider-

to-patient transmission of HBV; it does not address infection 

control measures to prevent bloodborne transmission of HBV 

to patients through receipt of human blood products, organs, 

or tissues because these measures have been described elsewhere 

(2). Nor does this report provide comprehensive guidance 

about prevention of patient-to-health-care provider bloodborne 

pathogen transmission because this guidance also has been 

published previously (3,4). On the basis of a through literature 

review, reports of providers who experienced curtailed scope of 

practice, and expert consultation, CDC considered the following 

issues when developing these recommendations:1) very rare or, for 

most types of clinical practice, no detected transmission of HBV 

from providers to patients; 2) nationally decreasing trends in the 

incidence of acute HBV infection in both the general population 

and health-care providers; 3) successful implementation and 

efficacy of policies promoting hepatitis B vaccination; 4) evolving 

and improving therapies for HBV infection; 5) guidelines in 

the United States and other developed countries that propose 

expert-based approaches to the risk management of infected 

health-care providers; 6) the adoption of Standard Precautions 

(formerly known as universal precautions) as a primary prevention 

intervention for the protection of patients and providers from 

infectious agent transmission; 7) the implementation of improved 

work practice and engineering controls, including safety devices; 8) 

the testing and vaccination of providers; 9) increasing availability 

of HBV viral load testing; and 10) instances of restrictions or 

prohibitions for HBV-infected providers and students that are 

not consistent with CDC and other previous recommendations. 

Methods 

To update recommendations for the risk management of HBV-

infected health-care providers and students, CDC considered 

data that have become available since the 1991 recommendations 

were published. Information reviewed was obtained through 

literature searches both by standard search engines (PubMed) 

and of other literature reviews used in guidelines developed by 

other professional organizations since 1991. Search terms used 

included “hepatitis B,” “hepatitis B virus,” or “HBV” with 

“healthcare,” “health-care,” “healthcare workers” or “providers” 

or “personnel”; “nosocomial” or “healthcare transmission”; and 

“healthcare worker-to-patient.” However, these searches did not 

identify additional cases beyond the few already known to CDC 

and the experts consulted. To gather data on HBV transmission, 

CDC reviewed all hepatitis B outbreak investigations conducted 

by CDC and state officials since 1991. CDC national hepatitis 

surveillance data were examined for reports of acute HBV 

infection in persons with information about recent health 

care, as well as reports received regarding dismissal of HBV-

infected health-care providers (i.e., surgeons) or prohibition 

from matriculation of medical, dental, and osteopathic students 

identified as HBV-infected after acceptance (see Actions Taken 

Against HBV-Infected Health Care Providers and Students). 

Medical, dental, infection control, public health, infectious 

disease, and hepatology experts, officials, and representatives 

from government, academia, the public, organizations 

representing medical, dental and osteopathic colleges, and 

professional medical organizations were consulted.* Some 

were consulted at an initial meeting on June 4, 2011. All 

experts and organizations were provided draft copies of these 

recommendations as they were developed, and they provided 

insights, information, suggestions, and edits. In finalizing these 

recommendations, CDC considered all available information, 

including expert opinion, results of the literature review, 

findings of outbreak investigations, surveillance data, and 

reports of adverse actions taken against HBV-infected surgeons 

and students. 

Major Trends in Regard to Providers 

with HBV Infection 

Health-Care Provider-to-Patient 

Transmission of HBV 

Since publication of the 1991 CDC recommendations (1), 

CDC has accrued substantial information about HBV-infected 

health-care providers and students. Many interventions, 

including the adoption of Standard Precautions (formerly known 

as universal precautions) and double-gloving during invasive 

surgical procedures, have eliminated almost completely the very 

low risk for transmission of HBV (as well as hepatitis C virus 

[HCV] and human immunodeficiency virus) during exposure-

prone procedures. In developing these recommendations, CDC 

weighed the risk for HBV transmission based on the following: 

* A list of the persons consulted appears on page 10.

1) documented cases of confirmed transmission of HBV from 

health-care providers to patients are rare (up to eight cases from 

one surgeon in the United States since 1994), 2) it has not 

been possible to conduct case-control or cohort studies that 

estimate the rate of such rare events, and 3) data are insufficient 

to quantify the strength-of-evidence or enable the grading of a 

recommendation (5). 

Nonetheless, CDC and state authorities have been able to 

detect instances of patient-to-patient transfer of HBV (and 

HCV) from unsafe injection and dialysis practices, sharing of 

blood-glucose monitoring equipment, and other unsanitary 

practices and techniques (6). One report from an oral surgery 

practice documented patient-to-patient HBV transmission, 

although a retrospective assessment did not identify 

inappropriate procedures (7). However, despite detecting 

patient-to-patient transmission, there is only one published 

report of health-care provider-to-patient transmission of HBV 

during exposure-prone procedures in the United States since 

1994 (8). In that case, an orthopedic surgeon who was unaware 

of his HBV status and who had a very high level of HBV DNA 

(viral load >17 million IU/ml) (9) transmitted HBV to between 

two and eight patients during August 2008–May 2009 (10). 

An international review of HBV health-care provider-to-

patient transmissions in other countries in which the HBV 

DNA levels (viral load) of the providers were measured has 

determined that 4 x 104 genome equivalents per ml (GE/ml) 

(roughly comparable to 8,000 international units (IU)/ml) 

was the lowest level of HBV DNA in any of several surgeons 

implicated in transmission of HBV to patients between 1992 

and 2008 (9–15; Table 1). This lowest measurement was 

taken >3 months after the suspected transmission event, so 

the relevance of the HBV DNA viral load to transmissibility 

is unclear. In general, those surgeons who transmitted HBV to 

patients appear to have had HBV DNA viral loads well above 

105 GE/ml (or above 20,000 IU/ml) at the earliest time that 

viral load was tested after transmission (Table 1). However, the 

few studies conducted in nonhuman primates have reported 

different results regarding the correlation between HBV DNA 

levels in blood and infectivity. One study found a correlation 

(16), but another did not (17). 

In addition to the rarity of surgery-related transmission of 

HBV since 1994 (one reported instance), the most recent 

case of HBV transmission from a U.S. dental health-care 

provider to patients was reported in 1987 (18,19). Since this 

event, certain infection control measures are thought to have 

contributed to the absence of detected transmissions; such 

measures include widespread vaccination of dental health-care 

professionals, universal glove use, and adherence to the tenets 

of the 1991 Occupational Safety and Health Administration 

(OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (20). Since 1991, no 

transmission of HBV has been reported in the United States 

or other developed countries from primary care providers, 

clinicians, medical or dental students, residents, nurses, other 

health-care providers, or any others who would not normally 

perform exposure-prone procedures (21). 

National Trends in Acute Hepatitis B 

Incidence and Prevalence 

Symptomatic acute HBV infections in the United States, 

as reported through health departments to CDC, have 

declined approximately 85% from the early 1990s to 2009 

(22), following the adoption of universal infant vaccination 

and catch-up vaccinations for children and adolescents (23). 

If declining trends continue, an ever-increasing proportion 

of patients receiving health care and their providers will be 

protected by receipt of hepatitis B vaccination. 

Patient-to-health-care provider transmission of HBV also has 

declined markedly. Reflecting this finding, the reported number 

of acute HBV infections among providers in the United States, 

not all of which reflect occupational exposure, decreased from 

approximately 10,000 in 1983 to approximately 400 in 2002 

(24) and to approximately 100 by 2009 (22). 

Treatments for Chronic 

Hepatitis B Infection 

Medications for hepatitis B have been improving continually 

and are usually effective at reducing viral loads markedly or even to 

undetectable levels. Currently, seven therapeutic agents are approved 

by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic 

hepatitis B, including two formulations of interferon (interferon 

alpha and pegylated interferon) and five nucleoside or nucleotide 

analogs (lamuvidine, telbivudine, abacavir, entecavir, and tenofovir). 

Among the approved analogs, both entecavir and tenofovir have 

potent antiviral activity as well as very low rates of drug resistance. 

Treatment with these agents reduces HBV DNA levels to undetectable 

or nearly undetectable levels in most treated persons (25–27). 

Virtually all treated patients, even those few still receiving older agents 

(e.g., lamuvidine), can expect to achieve a reduction of HBV DNA 

viral loads to very low levels within weeks or months of initiating 

therapy (25). The newer medications are effective in suppressing 

viral replication, and it is expected that they will be used for a newly 

identified HBV-infected health-care provider who is performing 

exposure-prone procedures and who has HBV virus levels above the 

threshold suggested in this report (1,000 IU/ml [i.e., about 5,000 

genome equivalents (GE)/ml]) or as adopted by his or her institution’s 

expert review panel. However, clinicians caring for infected health-

care providers or students who are not performing exposure-prone 

procedures and who are not subject to expert panel review should 

consider both the benefits and risks associated with life-long antiviral 

therapy for chronic HBV started at young ages (25). 

Consistency with Other Guidelines 

Recommendations for the management of HBV-infected 

health-care providers and students have evolved in the United 

States and other developed countries (Table 2). In 2010, the 

Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) 

issued updated guidelines that recommended a process 

for ensuring safe clinical practice by HBV-infected health-

care providers and students (28). These separate guidelines 

classify many invasive procedures and list those associated 

with potentially increased risk for provider-to-patient blood 

exposures (Category III procedures, in the SHEA guidelines). 

SHEA recommends restricting a provider’s practice on the 

basis of the provider’s HBV DNA blood levels and the conduct 

of certain invasive procedures considered exposure prone. 

The SHEA guidelines also address the current therapeutic 

interventions that reduce the viral loads and the infectiousness 

of HBV-infected personnel. For providers practicing certain 

exposure-prone procedures, SHEA recommends that they 

maintain HBV blood levels <104 GE/ml, i.e., depending on 

the assay used, approximately 2,000 IU/ml (exposure prone, 

Category III) procedures, or cease surgery until they can 

reestablish a viral load level below that threshold. 

Restrictions based on the provider’s HBV DNA blood levels 

also exist in guidelines published by some European countries 

and Canada (Table 2) (21,29–36). No guidelines from any 

developed country recommend the systematic prohibition of 

invasive surgical or dental practices by qualified health-care 

providers whose chronic HBV infection is monitored. 

The generally permissive principles delineated in the CDC 

1991 recommendations also have been reiterated in recent 

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 

recommendations on immunization of health-care personnel in 

the United States for HBV infection (37). ACIP recommends 

that HBV-infected persons who perform highly exposure-prone 

procedures should be monitored by a panel of experts drawn 

from diverse disciplines and perspectives to ensure balanced 

recommendations. However, the ACIP recommendations do 

not require that HBV-infected persons who do not perform 

such procedures have their clinical duties restricted or managed 

by a special panel because of HBV infection alone. 

Prevention Strategies 

Standard Precautions 

Strategies to promote patient safety and to prevent 

transmission of bloodborne viruses in health-care settings 

include hepatitis B vaccination of susceptible health-care 

personnel and the use of primary prevention (i.e., preventing 

exposures and therefore infection) by strict adherence to the 

tenets of standard (universal) infection control precautions, 

the use of safer devices (engineering controls), and the 

implementation of work practice controls (e.g., not recapping 

needles) to prevent injuries that confer risks for HBV 

transmission to patients and their providers. Public health 

officials in the United States base Standard Precautions on the 

premise that all blood and blood-containing body fluids are 

potentially infectious (3,4). Since 1996, CDC has specified 

the routine use of Standard Precautions (38,39) that include 

use of protective equipment in appropriate circumstances, 

implementation of both work practice controls and 

engineering controls, and adherence to meticulous standards 

for cleaning and reusing patient care equipment. For example, 

double-gloving now is practiced widely, and the evidence 

to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of this and other 

interventions is extensive (40–44). 

Work Practice and Engineering Controls 

 Parenteral exposures are mainly responsible for HBV 

transmission in health-care settings. Work practice modifications 

in the past 20 years have been important in mitigating such 

exposures. Examples of such modifications include the practice 

of not resheathing needles, the use of puncture-resistant needle 

and sharp object disposal containers, avoidance of unnecessary 

phlebotomies and other unnecessary needle and sharp object 

use, the use of ports and other needleless vascular access 

when practical or possible, and the avoidance of unnecessary 

intravenous catheters by using needleless or protected needle 

infusion systems. 

Testing and Vaccination of 

Health-Care Providers 

Recommendations generated over the past 20 years, both 

in the United States and other developed countries, urge all 

health-care providers to know their HBV and other bloodborne 

virus infection status (21), especially if they are at risk for HBV 

infection (37,45). OSHA mandates that hepatitis B vaccine 

be made available to health-care providers who are susceptible 

to HBV infection and that they be urged to be vaccinated 

(Bloodborne Pathogens Standard [29 CFR 1910.1030 and 29 

CFR 1910.030f]) These guidelines stipulate that the employer 

make available the hepatitis B vaccine and vaccination series 

to all employees who have occupational exposure and that 

postexposure evaluation and follow-up be provided to all 

employees who have an exposure incident. 

Approximately 25% or more of medical and dental students 

(46,47) and many physicians, surgeons, and dentists in the 

United States have been born to mothers in or from countries 

in Asia (including India), Africa, and the Middle East with high 

and intermediate endemicity for HBV. CDC recommends that 

all health-care providers at risk for HBV infection be tested and 

that all those found to be susceptible should receive vaccine 

(37). Such testing is likely to detect chronically infected health-

care providers and students. Recommendations to ensure safe 

practice of health-care providers identified as chronic carriers 

of HBV should have reasonable and feasible oversight by the 

relevant school, hospital, or other health-care facility. 

 Actions Taken Against HBV-Infected 

Health-Care Providers and Students 

CDC is aware of several recent instances in which 

HBV-infected persons have been threatened with dismissal 

or actually dismissed from surgical practice on the basis of 

their HBV infection, and others have had their acceptances 

to medical or dental schools rescinded or deferred because of 

their infection (Joan M. Block, Hepatitis B Foundation, Anna 

S. F. Lok, University of Michigan Medical Center, personal 

communications, 2011). Some of these instances have involved 

requirements that the infected provider, applicant, or student 

demonstrate undetectable HBV viral load or hepatitis B 

e-antigen negativity and, in at least one case, that this be 

demonstrated continuously by weekly testing. These actions 

might not be based on clear written guidance and procedures 

at the institutions involved (48,49). 

Technical and Ethical Issues in 

Developing Recommendations 

Monitoring HBV DNA Level and 

Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg) 

Whereas the 1991 recommendations assessed the infectivity 

of surgeons and others performing invasive procedures based on 

the presence of HBeAg, documented transmissions of HBV to 

patients from several HBeAg-negative surgeons (12,15,50) led 

to examination of correlations between HBeAg and HBV viral 

load. Some of these HBeAg-negative persons, despite high rates 

of viral replication, might harbor pre-core mutants of the virus: 

that is, loss of HBeAg expression might result from a single 

nucleotide substitution that results in a stop codon preventing 

transcription (51,52). Persons with such HBV strains who test 

HBeAg-negative might nonetheless be infectious (despite the 

mutation) and even have a high concentration of virions in 

their blood. 

Recent guidelines from other bodies (Table 2) have 

recommended using HBV DNA serum levels in preference 

to HBeAg in determining infectivity. Several studies have 

documented numerous HBeAg-negative persons who have high 

circulating levels of HBV DNA, i.e., viral loads often 105 IU/

ml or more by various commercial assays: 78 HBeAg-negative 

Australian patients with median HBV DNA of 38,000 IU/

ml (determined by the Siemens Versant HBV DNA 3.0 assay) 

(53); 48 HBeAg-negative Greek patients with a median HBV 

DNA of 76,000 IU/ml (by Roche Amplicor HBV-Monitor) 

(54); 165 HBeAg-negative Korean patients with a mean HBV 

DNA of 155,000 IU/ml (by Roche COBAS TaqMan) (55); 

and 47 HBeAg-negative Chinese patients with median HBV 

DNA blood levels of 960,000 copies/ml (about 200,000 IU/

ml) (by PG Biotech [Shenzhan, China] PCR) (56). On the 

basis of these data, monitoring quantitative HBV DNA levels 

provides better information to serve as a predictive indicator of 

infectivity than is provided by monitoring HBeAg status alone. 




Assessing a Safe Level of HBV DNA 

Review of information concerning six HBeAg-negative 

surgeons who had transmitted hepatitis B to patients and 

whose HBV DNA had been determined (using both Chiron 

Quantiplex Branched DNA assay and Roche Amplicor 

HBV DNA Monitor assay) showed the lowest value (at 

one laboratory) in one surgeon to be 40,000 copies/ml 

(approximately 8,000 IU/ml) (9). However, because this 

quantification was performed more than 3 months after the 

transmission had taken place, correlative relevance is uncertain. 

In 2003, recommendations from the Netherlands set the level 

above which health-care providers should not be performing 

exposure prone procedures at HBV DNA levels 105 GE/ml 

or above (approximately 20,000 IU/ml). A larger European 

consortium set this restriction at HBV DNA levels ≥104 

GE/ml (approximately 2,000 IU/ml) (33) for persons who 

are HBeAg-negative. In 2010, this latter threshold, without a 

requirement for e-antigen negativity, was adopted in the U.S. 

SHEA Guidelines (28). U.K. guidelines for HBV-infected 

providers who are HBeAg-negative require these providers to 

achieve or maintain HBV DNA levels of <103 GE/ml (less 

than approximately 200 IU/ml) (31,57). 

Although newer assays such as real-time polymerase chain 

reaction (PCR) tests are expected to reduce the level of detection 

for HBV DNA to 10–20 IU/ml, this level could be undetectable 

in some assays in use in the United States. The lower limit 

of detection for four assays currently in use are 200 IU/ml 

(qualitative assay); 30–350 IU/ml (branched DNA assay); 30 IU/

ml (real-time PCR assay); and 10 IU/ml (real-time PCR assay). 

Thus, any requirement for demonstration of a viral load <200 

IU/ml will need to specify the use of an assay (usually real-time 

PCR) that can detect loads well below that threshold. 

Fluctuating HBV DNA Levels 

Persons who achieve and maintain HBV DNA blood concentrations 

below some designated threshold level or attain an undetectable level 

might have HBV DNA that is transiently elevated and detectable 

but not necessarily transmissible. Such instances might represent 

infrequent detections of virus at very low levels despite long-term 

suppression of virus on therapy (58) but also could represent, especially 

for persons taking older therapies, breakthrough of antiviral-drug 

resistant HBV (59). As assays become increasingly sensitive (newer 

ones can detect circulating HBV DNA down to 20–30 IU/ml), such 

transient elevations will be recognized increasingly and will trigger 

more frequent follow-up. If such an elevation in detectable HBV 

DNA represents not spontaneous fluctuation (sometimes referred 

to as a blip) but rather therapeutic drug failure (i.e., breakthrough), 

then appropriate change in therapy may be considered. 

Specifying Exposure-Prone Procedures 

In general, three conditions are necessary for health-care 

personnel to pose a risk for bloodborne virus transmission to 

patients. First, the health-care provider must be sufficiently 

viremic (i.e., have infectious virus circulating in the 

bloodstream). Second, the health-care provider must have an 

injury (e.g., a puncture wound) or a condition (e.g., nonintact 

skin) that allows exposure to his/her blood or other infectious 

body fluids. Third, the provider’s blood or infectious body 

fluid must come in direct contact with a patient’s wound, 

traumatized tissue, mucous membranes, or similar portal of 

entry during an exposure-prone procedure. The vast majority 

of HBV-infected health-care personnel pose no risk for patients 

because they do not perform activities in which both the second 

and third conditions are met. 

Beyond meeting these three basic conditions, defining 

exposure-prone invasive procedures that pose a risk for HBV 

transmission between infected provider and patient has been 

problematic in the development of all recommendations and 

guidelines; this process is made especially difficult by varying 

surgical techniques used by health-care providers doing the 

same procedure. More recent guidelines and published articles 

indicate that exposure-prone procedures can be defined 

broadly, and lists of potentially exposure-prone procedures have 

been developed (28,31,60). Principles cited are that exposure-

prone procedures include those in which access for surgery is 

difficult (28) or those in which needlestick injuries are likely to 

occur (60), typically in very closed and unvisualized operating 

spaces in which double gloving and the skin integrity of the 

operator might be compromised (Box). 

Defining exposure-prone procedures in dentistry and 

oral surgery has been particularly difficult. Many intra-oral 

procedures (e.g., injection or scaling) occur in a confined 

cavity and might lead to injuries to the operator (61), so some 

institutions have considered these procedures to be exposure-

prone. However, no transmission of HBV from a U.S. dentist 

to a patient has been reported since 1987, and no transmission 

has ever been reported from a dental or medical student. Thus, 

Category I Procedures (Box) include only major oral surgery, 

and do not include the procedures that medical and dental 

students or most dentists would be performing or assisting. 

In addition to these lists of specific procedures, an 

institutional expert review panel convened to oversee an HBV-

infected surgeon or other health-care provider performing 

exposure-prone procedures may consult the classification 

of such procedures (Box) for guidance. Given the variety 

of procedures, practices, and providers, each HBV-infected 

health-care provider performing potentially exposure-prone 

procedures will need individual consideration. However, this 

evaluation should not define exposure-prone procedures too 

broadly; the great majority of surgical and dental procedures 

have not been associated with the transmission of HBV. 

Notification of Patients of HBV-Infected 

Health-Care Providers 

There is no clear justification for or benefit from routine 

notification of the HBV infection status of a health-care provider 

to his or her patient with the exception of instances in which 

an infected provider transmits HBV to one or more patients or 

documented instances in which a provider exposes a patient to a 

bloodborne infection. Routine mandatory disclosure might actually 

be counterproductive to public health, as providers and students 

might perceive that a positive test would lead to loss of practice 

or educational opportunities. This misperception might lead to 

avoidance of HBV testing, of hepatitis B vaccination (if susceptible), 

of treatment and management (if infected), or of compliance with 

practice oversight from an expert panel (if infected and practicing 

exposure-prone procedures). In general, a requirement for disclosure 

is accepted to be an insurmountable barrier to practice and might 

limit patient and community access to quality medical care. 

Ethical Considerations 

On July 18, 2011, the Consult Subcommittee of CDC’s 

Public Health Ethics Committee reviewed these proposed 

recommendations. The reviewing team also included three 

external ethicists. The opinion of the Consult Subcommittee 

was that guidelines that allow providers with HBV to practice 

while requiring those doing exposure-prone procedures to 

be monitored to maintain low load strikes the right balance 

between protecting patients’ interests and providers’ rights. 

The Consult Subcommittee also noted that providers have an 

ethical and professional obligation to know their HBV status 

and to act on such knowledge accordingly (CDC Public Health 

Ethics Committee, personal communication, 2011). The 

Consult Subcommittee supported the new recommendation 

that mandatory disclosure of provider HBV status to patients 

was no longer warranted and that the 1991 recommendation 

for disclosure was discriminatory and unwarranted. 

In addition, the Consult Subcommittee determined that 

there was no scientific or ethical basis for the restrictions that 

some medical and dental schools have placed on HBV-infected 

students and concluded that such restrictions were detrimental 

to the professions as well as to the individual students.

Guidance for Expert Review 

Panels at Institutions 

HBV infection in health-care providers and students who 

do not perform invasive exposure-prone procedures should 

be managed as a personal health issue and does not require 

special panel oversight. However, for providers who perform 

exposure-prone procedures, all recent guidelines advocate the 

constitution of an expert panel to provide oversight of the 

infected health-care provider’s practice (Table 2). 

For HBV-infected providers performing exposure-prone 

procedures, expert review panels should evaluate the infected 

provider’s clinical and viral burden status; assess his or 

her practices, procedures and techniques, experience, and 

adherence to recommended surgical and dental technique; 

provide recommendations, counseling, and oversight of the 

provider’s continued practice or study within the institution; and 

investigate and notify appropriate persons and authorities (e.g., 

risk management or, if need be, licensure boards) for suspected 

and documented breaches (62) in procedure or incidents 

resulting in patient exposure. The panel should reinforce the 

need for Standard Precautions (e.g., double gloving, regular 

glove changes, and use of blunt surgical needles). Panels may 

appropriately provide counseling about alternate procedures 

or specialty paths, especially for providers, students, residents, 

and others early in their careers, as long as this is not coercion 

or limitation (perceived or actual) of the provider or student. 

The members of the expert review panel may be selected 

from, but should not necessarily be limited to, the following: 

one or more persons with expertise in the provider’s specialty; 

infectious disease and hospital epidemiology specialists; liver 

disease specialists (gastroenterologists); the infected providers’ 

occupational health, student health, or primary care physicians; 

ethicists; human resource professionals; hospital or school 

administrators; and legal counsel. Certain members of the 

panel should be familiar with issues relating to bloodborne 

pathogens and their infectivity. 

In instances when it is generally accepted (or thought) 

that a patient might have been exposed to the blood of an 

infected health-care provider, institutions should have in 

place a protocol for communicating to the patient that such 

an exposure might have occurred. The patient should receive 

appropriate follow-up including post-exposure vaccination or 

receipt of hepatitis B immune globulin and testing (i.e., similar 

to the reverse situation of prophylaxis for providers exposed to 

the blood of an HBV-infected patient). 

The confidentiality of the infected provider or student 

should be respected. Certain expert review panels might elect 

to consider cases without knowledge of the name of the infected 

provider or student. However, awareness of the infected 

provider’s or student’s identity might be unavoidable. In such 

cases, respect for the confidentiality of the person under review 

should be accorded as it is for any other patient. 

Recommendations for Chronically 

HBV-Infected Health-Care Providers 

and Students 

CDC recommends the following measures for the management 

of hepatitis B virus–infected health-care providers and students: 

Practice Scope 

•	 Chronic HBV infection in itself should not preclude the 

practice or study of medicine, surgery, dentistry, or allied 

health professions. Standard Precautions should be adhered 

to rigorously in all health-care settings for the protection 

of both patient and provider. 

•	 CDC discourages constraints that restrict chronically HBV-

infected health-care providers and students from the practice 

or study of medicine, dentistry, or surgery, such as 

 – repeated demonstration of persistently nondetectable 

viral loads on a greater than semiannual frequency; 

 – prenotification of patients of the HBV-infection status 

of their care giver; 

 – mandatory antiviral therapy with no other option such 

as maintenance of low viral load without therapy; and

 – forced change of practice, arbitrary exclusion from 

exposure-prone procedures, or any other restriction 

that essentially prohibits the health-care provider from 

practice or the student from study. 

Hepatitis B Vaccination and Screening 

•	 All health-care providers and students should receive hepatitis B 

vaccine according to current CDC recommendations 

(37,45,63). Vaccination (3-dose series) should be followed by 

assessment of hepatitis B surface antibody to determine 

vaccination immunogenicity and, if necessary, revaccination. 

Health-care providers who do not have protective concentration 

of anti-HBs (>10 mIU/ml) after revaccination (i.e., after 

receiving a total of 6 doses) should be tested for HBsAg and 

anti-HBc to determine their infection status (37). 

•	 Prevaccination serologic testing is not indicated for most 

persons being vaccinated, except for those providers and 

students at increased risk for HBV infection (37), such as 

those born to mothers in or from endemic countries and 

sexually active men who have sex with men (64). 

•	 Providers who are performing exposure-prone procedures 

also should receive prevaccination testing for chronic HBV 

infection. Exposure of a patient to the blood of an 

HBV-infected health-care provider, in the performance of 

any procedure, should be handled with postexposure 

prophylaxis and testing of the patient in a manner similar 

to the reverse situation (i.e., prophylaxis for providers 

exposed to the blood of an HBV-infected patient) (65).

 Expert Panel Oversight Not Needed 

•	 Providers, residents, and medical and dental students with 

active HBV infection (i.e., those who are HBsAg-positive) 

who do not perform exposure-prone procedures but who 

practice non- or minimally invasive procedures (Category 

II, Box) should not be subject to any restrictions of their 

activities or study. They do not need to achieve low or 

undetectable levels of circulating HBV DNA, hepatitis 

e-antigen negativity, or have review and oversight by an 

expert review panel, as recommended for those performing 

exposure-prone procedures. However, they should receive 

medical care for their condition by clinicians, which might 

be in the setting of student or occupational health. 

Expert Panel Oversight Recommended 

•	 Surgeons, including oral surgeons, obstetrician/gynecologists, 

surgical residents, and others who perform exposure-prone 

procedures, i.e., those listed under Category I activities 

(Box), should fulfill the following criteria: 

 – Consonant with the 1991 recommendations and 

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 

recommendations (37), their procedures should be 

guided by review of a duly constituted expert review 

panel with a balanced perspective (i.e., providers’ and 

students’ personal, occupational or student health 

physicians, infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists, 

ethicists and others as indicated above) regarding the 

procedures that they can perform and prospective 

oversight of their practice (28). Confidentiality of the 

health-care provider’s or student’s HBV serologic status 

should be maintained. 

 – HBV-infected providers can conduct exposure-prone 

procedures if a low or undetectable HBV viral load is 

documented by regular testing at least every 6 months 

unless higher levels require more frequent testing; for 

example, as drug therapy is added or modified or testing 

is repeated to determine if elevations above a threshold 

are transient. 

 – CDC recommends that an HBV level 1,000 IU/ml 

(5,000 GE/ml) or its equivalent is an appropriate 

threshold for a review panel to adopt. Monitoring should 

be conducted with an assay that can detect as low as 

10–30 IU/ml, especially if the individual institutional 

expert review panel wishes to adopt a lower threshold. 

 – Spontaneous fluctuations (blips) of HBV DNA levels 

and treatment failures might both present as higher-than-

threshold (1,000 IU/ml; 5,000 GE/ml) values. This will 

require the HBV-infected provider to abstain from 

performing exposure-prone procedures, while subsequent 

retesting occurs, and if needed, modifications or 

additions to the health-care provider’s drug therapy and 

other reasonable steps are taken. 

Institutional Policies and Procedures 

•	 Hospitals, medical and dental schools, and other institutions 

should have written policies and procedures for the 

identification and management of HBV-infected health-care 

providers, students, and school applicants. These policies 

should include the ability to identify and convene an expert 

review panel (see Guidance for Expert Review Panels) aware 

of these and other relevant guidelines and recommendations 

before considering the management of HBV-infected 

providers performing exposure-prone procedures.
