Guiding Principles and

Objectives

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

This document presents ofﬁcial recommendations

of the American Association for the Study of Liver

Diseases (AASLD) on the surveillance, diagnosis, and

treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occur-

ring in the setting of adults with cirrhosis. Unlike pre-

vious

AASLD

practice

guidelines,

the

current

guideline was developed in compliance with the Insti-

tute of Medicine standards for trustworthy practice

guidelines and uses the Grading of Recommendation

Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)

approach.(1) Multiple systematic reviews of the litera-

ture were conducted to support the recommendations

in this practice guideline. An enhanced understanding

of the guideline can be obtained by reading the appli-

cable portions of the systematic reviews. In addition,

more detailed information may be found in the associ-

ated guidance document related to clinically important

aspects of HCC that lacked sufﬁcient evidence to war-

rant a systematic review.

The guideline focuses on a broad spectrum of clinical

practice, including surveillance of patients with cirrhosis

for HCC, establishing the diagnosis of HCC, and vari-

ous therapeutic options for the treatment of HCC. To

address other issues on HCC such as epidemiology, stag-

ing, and additional aspects of diagnosis and treatment,

the authors have created a new guidance document that

will be published soon and is based upon the previous

HCC AASLD guidelines by Bruix and Sherman.(2)

KEY QUESTIONS

The guideline developers from the AASLD identi-

ﬁed key questions that health care providers are faced

with frequently in the evaluation and management of

patients with HCC. These questions were:

1. Should adults with cirrhosis undergo surveillance

for HCC? If so, which surveillance test is best?

2. Should adults with cirrhosis and suspected HCC

undergo diagnostic evaluation with multiphasic

Background

BURDEN OF DISEASE

According to the World Health Organization,

HCC is the ﬁfth most common tumor worldwide and

the second most common cause of cancer-related death

(http://globocan.iarc.fr/old/FactSheets/cancers/liver-new.

asp). Male-to-female predominance is greater than 2:1

with liver cancer, and approximately 83% of the estimat-

ed 782,000 new HCC cases in 2012 occurred in less

developed regions of the world, with East and South

Asia plus sub-Saharan Africa being the regions of high-

est incidence, Southern Europe and North America

being the regions of intermediate incidence, and North-

ern Europe and South Central Asia being the regions of

lowest incidence.(3)

The incidence of HCC has been rising rapidly in the

United States over the last 20 years.(4) According to esti-

mates from the Surveillance Epidemiology End Results

(SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute, the

United States will have witnessed an estimated 39,230

cases of HCC and 27,170 HCC deaths in 2016 (https://

seer.cancer.gov). In addition, a recent study using the

SEER registry projects that the incidence of HCC will

continue to rise until 2030,(5) with the highest increase in

Hispanics, followed by African Americans and then Cau-

casians, with a decrease noted among Asian Americans.

The increase in incidence of HCC in the United States is

attributed primarily to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epi-

demic, prompting Petrick et al.(4) to suggest that preven-

tive efforts should target the birth cohort with the highest

prevalence of HCV infection (1945-1965). Recent data

have also shown that metabolic disorders—deﬁned as

nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the meta-

bolic syndrome—contribute numerically more to the bur-

den of HCC than any other risk factor including HCV

infection,(6) which is due primarily to the high prevalence

of NAFLD in the population overall.

HIGH-RISK GROUP

The presence of cirrhosis represents a key risk factor

for the development of HCC. The prevalence of cir-

rhosis among patients with HCC has been estimated

to be 85%-95%,(7,8) and the HCC incidence rate

among patients with cirrhosis has been shown to be

2%-4% per year.(9) Therefore, patients with cirrhosis

constitute a high-risk group for efforts at prevention

and early detection. The fact that patients with HCC

have underlying liver disease impacts the management

and therapeutic options substantially.

The key questions posed above reﬂect common sce-

narios in this patient population and provide the frame-

work for this practice guideline. We used the Child-

Pugh classiﬁcation to deﬁne the underlying degree of

liver dysfunction instead of the Model for End-Stage

Liver Disease (MELD) classiﬁcation, mainly because it

is more commonly used in this context.

Strong

Population: Most people in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not.

Health care workers: Most people should receive the recommended course of action.

Policy makers: The recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations.

Conditional

Population: The majority of people in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not.

Health care workers: Be prepared to help patients make a decision that is consistent with their values using decision aids and shared decision

making.

Policy makers: There is a need for substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders.

For patients, a strong recommendation implies that most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only

a small proportion would not. For clinicians, this would imply that patients should receive the recommended course of action, with consis-

tent beneﬁts and few side effects. For policy makers, the recommendation could be adopted as a policy in most situations and potentially

could be used as a quality measure. For strong recommendations, the recommendation is prefaced by “The AASLD recommends...”

In contrast, a conditional recommendation (also sometimes termed a “weak” recommendation) for patients would imply that the

majority of patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not. For clinicians making a

conditional recommendation, the balance of beneﬁts, harms, and burdens is uncertain; and they should be prepared to help patients

make a decision that is consistent with their own values using a shared decision-making approach. For policy makers, this recommen-

dation type could imply a need for substantial debate and involvement of all stakeholders and is likely insufﬁcient to be used as a qual-

ity measure. For conditional recommendations, the recommendation is prefaced by “The AASLD suggests...”

questions. A group of AASLD content experts worked

collaboratively with an independent research group

specializing in conducting systematic reviews to syn-

thesize the available evidence. The research group pro-

vided

curated

evidence

summaries

following

the

GRADE approach (Table 1).(1) In this approach, the

quality of evidence in each systematic review is rated as

high, moderate, low, or very low based on the domains

of precision, directness, consistency, and risk of bias.

Following a comprehensive analysis of each systematic

review, the guideline writing group based its recom-

mendations on the quality of the evidence, balance of

beneﬁts and harms, patients’ values and preferences,

and other clinical considerations. Based on this assess-

ment, the guideline writing group generated AASLD

recommendations that are graded as either strong

(apply to most patients with minimal variation) or con-

ditional (apply to a majority of patients). The strength

of recommendation is not only determined by the

quality of evidence. Other factors—including the bal-

ance of beneﬁts and harms, patients’ values and prefer-

ences, and feasibility of the recommended action—all

play a role in determining the strength of recommen-

dations.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

1C. The AASLD suggests not performing surveil-

lance of patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis

unless they are on the transplant waiting list, given the

low anticipated survival for these patients.

Quality/Certainty of the Evidence: Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. It is not possible to determine which type of sur-

veillance test—US alone or the combination of

US plus AFP—leads to a greater improvement in

survival.

2. The optimal interval of surveillance ranges from 4

to 8 months.

3. Modification in surveillance strategy based on eti-

ology of liver diseases or risk stratification models

cannot be recommended at this time.

BACKGROUND

The goal of surveillance and screening is to reduce

mortality.(10) HCC meets the criteria for the develop-

ment of a surveillance program(11) given that patients

with cirrhosis are a high-risk group(7) and can be readi-

ly identiﬁed. The previous AASLD guidelines on

HCC(2) summarize the populations at the highest risk

to have chronic viral hepatitis B and cirrhosis due to

HCV. A randomized surveillance study performed in

another high-risk group, hepatitis B virus (HBV) car-

riers, showed a 37% reduction in mortality for those

who underwent surveillance.(12) However, there are no

randomized trials in Western populations with cirrho-

sis secondary to chronic HCV or fatty liver disease,

and thus there is some controversy surrounding wheth-

er surveillance truly leads to a reduction in mortality in

this population of patients with cirrhosis. Another

source of controversy is which surveillance tests should

be used. Although it is well established that US should

be part of surveillance, it is unknown whether the addi-

tion of biomarkers such as AFP allows for improved

survival. The previous AASLD guidelines recommend

US as the primary modality.(2) Because of these uncer-

tainties, the aim of this question was to determine

whether current data are in support of HCC surveil-

lance in adults with cirrhosis, and if so, what type of

surveillance is best.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The evidence proﬁle of surveillance for HCC is

included in Supporting Table 1, which uses the data

from a recent systematic review on surveillance.(13)

There were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of

surveillance in patients with cirrhosis. There were 38

observational cohort studies that evaluated surveillance

in patients with cirrhosis, making the overall quality of

the evidence moderate (Supporting Table 1). The

majority of the data was reported with 3-year survival.

The pooled 3-year survival rate was 50.8% among the

4735 patients who underwent HCC surveillance, com-

pared with only 27.9% among the 6115 patients with-

out previous surveillance, with an odds ratio (OR) of

1.90 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.67-2.17; P &lt;

0.001). There were six studies that controlled for lead-

time bias, and the improvement in survival persisted (3-

year survival rates of 39.7% for surveillance versus

29.1% without surveillance; P &lt; 0.001). Of the 23 stud-

ies evaluated, 10 were considered high-quality studies in

which the 3-year survival with surveillance was greater

than no surveillance (45.6% versus 28.8%; P &lt; 0.001.)

In addition to improved survival, surveillance also led

to an increase in the detection of early-stage HCC, with

an OR of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.88-2.33) compared with no

surveillance. In terms of anticipated absolute effects,

surveillance led to 163 per 1000 more patients detected

at early stages compared with no surveillance. In addi-

tion, surveillance led to more curative treatments com-

pared with no surveillance (61.8% versus 38.2%; P &lt;

0.001). Thus, improvement in survival seen with sur-

veillance appears to be due to higher early-stage detec-

tion and higher curative treatment rates.

The surveillance tests used most commonly were US

and AFP. Of the studies identiﬁed, only four used US

alone, whereas the rest relied on US and AFP at 6-

month intervals. The use of US plus AFP improves

detection of early-stage HCC compared with no surveil-

lance, with an OR of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.80-2.60), whereas

US alone had an OR of 2.04 (95% CI, 1.55-2.68). Both

US alone and US plus AFP led to similar rates of cura-

tive treatment (OR, 2.23 for US [95% CI, 1.83-2.71]

and 2.19 for US plus AFP [95% CI, 1.89-2.53]). There

were no studies that directly compared US alone versus

US plus AFP to determine which was superior in terms

of early-stage detection or curative therapy.

The studies were also evaluated to determine wheth-

er US alone or US plus AFP improved survival. US

plus AFP had a pooled risk ratio of 1.86 (95% CI,

1.76-1.97) for improving survival, whereas US alone

HEIMBACH ET AL.

HEPATOLOGY, January 2018

362


had a slightly lower pooled risk ratio of 1.75 (95% CI,

1.56-1.98) for improving survival. There was no statis-

tical difference between the two strategies. However,

there are serious issues when comparing these surveil-

lance tests for their impact on survival, which include:

(1) no description of the trigger to perform a diagnos-

tic test, (2) some studies appear to evaluate AFP or US

rather than the combination, (3) no mention of the

performance characteristics of these tests, and (4) most

importantly, the studies were not powered to deter-

mine an improvement in survival.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Given the current burden of HCC and the projected

continued increase in incidence of this tumor, better

studies including appropriate study design comparing

US with US plus AFP as surveillance strategies are

needed. Such studies should evaluate the characteristics

of US, including its operator dependency and reliabili-

ty as a surveillance test in speciﬁc patient populations.

In addition, it would be important to determine

whether other serum biomarkers in addition to AFP

complement US, such as des-gamma carboxy pro-

thrombin, AFP L3, and other novel serum tests.(14)

2. SHOULD ADULTS WITH

CIRRHOSIS AND SUSPECTED

HCC UNDERGO DIAGNOSTIC

EVALUATION WITH

MULTIPHASIC CT OR

MULTIPHASIC MRI?

Recommendation

2. The AASLD recommends diagnostic evaluation

for HCC with either multiphasic CT or multiphasic

MRI

because

of

similar

diagnostic

performance

characteristics.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low for CT versus

MRI

Strength of Recommendation: Strong

Technical Remarks

1. The selection of the optimal modality and con-

trast agent for a particular patient depends on

multiple factors beyond diagnostic accuracy. These

include modality availability, scan time, through-

put, scheduling backlog, institutional technical

capability,

examination

costs

and

charges,

radiologist expertise, patient preference, and safety

considerations.

2. All studies were performed at academic centers.

Because of the greater technical complexity of

multiphasic MRI compared with multiphasic CT,

generalizability to practices without liver MRI

expertise is not yet established.

BACKGROUND

In patients with cirrhosis and suspected HCC, diag-

nostic imaging is used to noninvasively verify the pres-

ence of HCC (diagnosis) and determine its extent

(radiological staging). The goals are to measure tumor

burden,

guide

management,

and

help

prioritize

patients for possible liver transplantation. Unlike most

other malignancies, the diagnosis of HCC can be

established noninvasively, and treatment may be initi-

ated based on imaging alone, without conﬁrmatory

biopsy. The rationale is that in patients with cirrhosis,

the pretest probability of HCC is sufﬁciently high, and

the pretest probability of lesions that may mimic HCC

at imaging is sufﬁciently low such that a lesion meeting

HCC imaging criteria can be assumed reliably and

conﬁdently to be HCC. Although there is strong con-

sensus that the imaging diagnosis of HCC requires

multiphasic imaging, there is not agreement about

which diagnostic imaging test to use. Commonly used

methods in clinical practice include multiphasic CT

with extracellular agents, multiphasic MRI with extra-

cellular agents (gadolinium-based compounds that stay

in the extracellular space and permit characterization of

blood ﬂow), and multiphasic MRI with gadoxetate

disodium (a speciﬁc gadolinium-based compound that

accumulates in hepatocytes and permits characteriza-

tion of hepatocellular “function” in addition to blood

ﬂow).

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The evidence proﬁle of diagnostic accuracy for

HCC is included in Supporting Table 2, which uses

the data from a de novo systematic review on imaging

in HCC performed to address this question. There

were no randomized comparative studies of CT versus

MRI, no studies identiﬁed that compared multiphasic

MRI with an extracellular agent versus multiphasic

MRI with gadoxetate disodium, and no data on

patient preference. There were 19 observational studies

in patients with cirrhosis and suspected HCC that

compared the per-lesion diagnostic accuracy of CT

and MRI, reporting true positive, false positive, false

negative, and true negative values. An additional 14

studies reported only detection rate (sensitivity), but

these are not further discussed, as sensitivity cannot be

interpreted in the absence of data on speciﬁcity and/or

positive predictive value. Quality of evidence was low

and was downgraded because of the methodological

limitations of the included studies, inconsistency across

studies, and possible publication bias. The perfor-

mance characteristics of these imaging modalities over-

all and for lesions of different sizes are reviewed below.

With regard to overall accuracy, eight studies com-

pared multiphasic MRI using an extracellular agent

versus multiphasic CT. MRI with an extracellular

agent provided higher pooled sensitivity than CT

(0.76 [95% CI, 0.72-0.81] versus 0.63 [95% CI, 0.57-

0.69]; P &lt; 0.001) with similar speciﬁcity (0.78 [95%

CI, 0.63-0.88] versus 0.82 [95% CI, 0.71-0.89]; P 5

0.62). Eight studies compared multiphasic MRI with

gadoxetate disodium versus multiphasic CT. MRI

with gadoxetate disodium provided higher pooled sen-

sitivity than CT (0.87 [95% CI, 0.79-0.93] versus 0.73

[95% CI, 0.64-0.81]; P &lt; 0.02) with similar speciﬁcity

(0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.97] versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.90-

0.98]; P 5 0.47).

When looking speciﬁcally at lesions larger than 2

cm, three studies compared multiphasic MRI with an

extracellular agent versus multiphasic CT and showed

a similar pooled sensitivity, with a higher pooled spe-

ciﬁcity of 0.87 versus 0.7 (P 5 0.02). Examining accu-

racy in HCC between 1 and 2 cm, there were six

studies that compared multiphasic MRI versus CT,

and this also showed similar sensitivity and speciﬁcity.

For HCC &lt;1 cm, two studies compared multiphasic

CT versus multiphasic MRI with an extracellular

agent. The sensitivity of MRI for &lt;1 cm was signiﬁ-

cantly higher compared with CT (0.69 versus 0.49; P

5 0.049), whereas the speciﬁcity was, at a trend level,

lower (0.46 versus 0.69; P 5 0.08).

Although multiphasic MRI may be marginally

more sensitive than CT in a pooled analysis of com-

parative studies, the differences in pooled diagnostic

performance are insufﬁcient to recommend MRI over

CT. Mitigating factors include the low quality of the

evidence, concerns about generalizability to nonaca-

demic settings, and recognition that multiple factors

beyond diagnostic accuracy inform the selection of

optimal imaging modalities in individual patients.

Compared with multiphasic CT, multiphasic MRI

has important advantages and disadvantages. Advan-

tages

include greater soft tissue

contrast,

more

comprehensive assessment of nodule and background

liver tissue properties, and absence of ionizing radia-

tion. Disadvantages include greater technical com-

plexity,

longer

scan

times,

lower

throughput,

increased susceptibility to artifact, less consistent

image quality (largely because of patient factors such

as breath holding, difﬁculty holding still, or high-

volume ascites), larger number of potential contrain-

dications, higher charges, and—especially outside the

United States—lower availability and longer schedul-

ing backlogs. From a patient perspective, CT is faster,

more spacious, and provokes less claustrophobia, but

it exposes patients to radiation. Both modalities

require IV access and contrast agents, the use of

which may be problematic in patients with acute kid-

ney injury or chronic renal failure.(15,16)

FUTURE RESEARCH

Although not used widely in North America, multi-

phasic contrast-enhanced US also can be used to diag-

nose HCC noninvasively, and further studies are

needed.(17-24) Prospective studies should include mul-

tiphasic CT, multiphasic MRI with an extracellular

agent, and multiphasic MRI with gadoxetate disodium

8, and data on costs and patient preference should be

collected. Of note, a multicenter trial of US transplan-

tation patients with HCC underwent both MRI and

CT at multiple ﬁxed time points while awaiting trans-

plantation has recently completed enrollment and may

further elucidate which technique is optimal in this

particular patient population (NCT01082224.)

CIRRHOSIS AND AN

INDETERMINATE HEPATIC

NODULE UNDERGO A BIOPSY,

Recommendations

3A. The AASLD suggests several options in patients

with cirrhosis and an indeterminate nodule, including

3B. The AASLD suggests against routine biopsy of

every indeterminate nodule.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. Biopsy may be required in selected cases, but its

routine use is not suggested. Biopsy has the

potential to establish a timely diagnosis in cases in

which a diagnosis is required to affect therapeutic

decision making; however, biopsy has a risk of

bleeding, tumor seeding, and the possibility that a

negative biopsy is due to the failure to obtain tis-

sue representative of the nodule rather than a truly

benign nodule.

2. Stringent imaging criteria with high specificity for

�10 mm HCC have been developed by the

American College of Radiology through its Liver

Imaging

Reporting

and

Data

System

(LI-

RADS),(25) the OPTN,(26) and previous AASLD

guidelines,(2) and include arterial phase hyperen-

hancement in combination with washout appear-

ance and/or capsule appearance. Lesions that do

not meet these guidelines or are smaller than 1

cm are considered indeterminate.

BACKGROUND

In its previous HCC clinical practice guidelines,(2)

the AASLD recommended biopsy for all indeterminate

lesions initially detected by surveillance ultrasound, with

the presumed rationale being that biopsy can establish a

deﬁnitive diagnosis, thereby permitting earlier interven-

tion. Because of its many limitations, however, biopsy

may not be an optimal strategy in all cases. Biopsy is

expensive, may cause anxiety or pain, and has a risk of

complications, including tumor track seeding and bleed-

ing.(27) Sampling error, especially for very small lesions,

is an additional drawback. A negative biopsy may not

exclude malignancy, and repeated biopsies may be nec-

essary to establish a diagnosis. Follow-up imaging may

be especially relevant in patients awaiting liver trans-

plantation with a single small, indeterminate nodule,

given that biopsy conﬁrmation of &lt;20 mm HCC would

not change management or contribute to liver trans-

plantation priority. Because there is controversy regard-

ing optimal workup for an indeterminate nodule, the

aim of this question was to determine whether current

data are able to elucidate an optimal strategy.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The evidence proﬁle is included in Supporting Table

2, which uses the data from a de novo systematic review

on imaging in HCC performed to address this question.

Based on an extensive search strategy detailed in the sys-

tematic review, there were no comparative studies iden-

tiﬁed that directly address this question, although two

single-center, noncomparative studies were identiﬁed

that examined the role of biopsy.

Forner et al.(17) in 2008 reported outcomes for �2 cm

hepatic nodules detected during surveillance ultrasound

in patients with cirrhosis. The authors performed percu-

taneous biopsy of �2 cm nodules in addition to MRI

and contrast-enhanced US. They found a sensitivity and

speciﬁcity of MRI to be 61.7% and 96.6%, whereas

contrast-enhanced US was 51.7% and 93.1% compared

with the standard, which was biopsy. When both tests

were in concordance, the sensitivity was only 33%, with

100% speciﬁcity. Biopsy had a false negative rate of 30%,

as patients with suspicious imaging ﬁndings or growth

were rebiopsied up to three times. In 2011, Khalili et al.

(28) reported that in patients with cirrhosis, only 14%-

23% of 1- to 2-cm indeterminate nodules initially

detected at surveillance ultrasound are malignant. Given

the low likelihood of malignancy, they argued that biopsy

for all indeterminate hepatic nodules may be impractical

and suggested an alternative strategy of close follow-up

imaging with sequential contrast imaging using an alter-

nate technique for most indeterminate �2 cm nodules,

with biopsy reserved for 1-2 cm nodules with arterial

phase hyperenhancement or in the presence of a synchro-

nous HCC. Numerous other studies also reported low

likelihoods of malignancy among �2 cm indeterminate

nodules, as characterized by CT or MRI.(19,23,29-37)

Because many if not most indeterminate small hepat-

ic nodules are nonmalignant, strategies for risk stratiﬁ-

cation are needed. Tanabe et al.(38) evaluated the natural

history of indeterminate lesions detected at CT or

MRI. The indeterminate lesions were categorized as

probably benign, intermediate probability of HCC, and

probably HCC based only on imaging features.(25) No

lesions initially categorized as probably benign pro-

gressed to deﬁnite HCC during follow-up, whereas 7%

of lesions initially categorized as intermediate probabili-

ty progressed to HCC, and 38% of lesions initially cate-

gorized as probably HCC progressed to deﬁnite HCC.

Similarly, Darnell et al.(39) in 2015 showed that the vari-

ous LI-RADS categories are associated with different

likelihood of HCC in patients with cirrhosis, using con-

temporaneous biopsy as the reference standard.

HEIMBACH ET AL.

Taken together, these studies suggest that a substan-

tial proportion of 1- to 2-cm indeterminate nodules are

nonmalignant histologically and unlikely to progress to

HCC during imaging follow-up. Thus, a strategy of

obtaining a biopsy of all indeterminate nodules would

result in a considerable number of unnecessary biopsies.

However, indeterminate nodules do require further eval-

uation. Other diagnostic options include follow-up

imaging, imaging with an alternative modality or con-

trast agent, and referral to a specialty center. A study by

Serst�e et al.(40) performed CT, MRI, and biopsy for a

series of 74 patients with nodules identiﬁed by surveil-

lance ultrasound. The authors concluded that sensitivity

and speciﬁcity of the combination of the two diagnostic

tests was 98% and 81%, respectively, and that biopsy

could be reserved for those without deﬁnitive ﬁndings

on either CT or MRI. An individualized diagnostic

workup based on clinical context and imaging ﬁndings

such as nodule characteristics, feasibility of biopsy, and

institutional expertise may be the optimal approach. In

selected circumstances, a multidisciplinary group may

elect to treat a probable HCC without biopsy conﬁrma-

tion, though practitioners and patients need to be aware

that such treatment may affect transplant priority.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Future research is needed to standardize the deﬁni-

tion of and independently verify the prognostic value

of different nodule characteristics and to identify addi-

tional nonimaging features to more precisely predict

lesion progression,(38,39) potentially including end-

points other than survival, such as patient preference or

drop-off from the transplant waiting list.

4. SHOULD ADULTS WITH

CHILD-PUGH CLASS A

CIRRHOSIS AND EARLY-STAGE

HCC (T1 OR T2) BE TREATED

WITH RESECTION OR

LOCOREGIONAL THERAPY?

Recommendation

4. The AASLD suggests that adults with Child-

Pugh class A cirrhosis and resectable T1 or T2 HCC

undergo resection over radiofrequency ablation.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Moderate

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. Direct comparative studies of resection versus other

types of LRT—such as transarterial radioemboliza-

tion (TARE) and transarterial chemoembolization

(TACE) or other forms of ablative therapy, such

as radiation and microwave—are not available,

though indirect evidence favors resection.

2. The definition of resectability is not uniform

across studies or in clinical practice, and variability

is seen not only in what is defined as resectable

from a purely technical standpoint but also in

patient-related factors such as acceptable degree of

portal hypertension and performance status. This

variability leads to challenges in comparing study

findings.

3. Stage T1 and T2 HCC include a wide range of

tumor sizes from &lt;1 cm to 5 cm, and the effec-

tiveness of available therapies depend in large part

on the size, number, and location of the tumors.

Whereas smaller, single tumors (&lt;2.5 cm) that

are favorably located may be equally well treated

by either resection or ablation, tumors larger than

2.5-3 cm, multifocal, or near major vascular or

biliary

structures

may

have

limited

ablative

options. Multiple tumors that are bilobar or cen-

trally located may not be resectable.

4. Randomized trials performed to date comparing

radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to resection have

been performed primarily in East Asian patients,

in whom there is a higher etiologic prevalence of

HBV

(including

noncirrhotic

HBV–associated

HCC) and a lower prevalence of other liver dis-

eases such as NAFLD or HCV compared with

Western patients. The impact of these demo-

graphic differences on oncologic outcomes of dif-

ferent therapies is unknown.

BACKGROUND

Because cirrhosis is one of the primary risk factors

for HCC, the selection of treatment modality depends

as much on the underlying liver function and the

degree of portal hypertension as on the oncologic stage

of the tumor. Therefore, whereas therapeutic options

are limited for patients who present with advanced liv-

er disease and/or advanced tumor stages, multiple

options

exist

for

those

presenting

with

well-

compensated cirrhosis and smaller, potentially resect-

able tumors. These include ablative strategies such as

HEIMBACH ET AL.

HEPATOLOGY, January 2018

radiofrequency, microwave, chemical, and cryoabla-

tion, as well as surgical resection. Most studies deﬁne

patients with resectable HCC as those (1) with one to

three unilobar lesions, with an upper size limit of 5 cm

for single lesions and 3 cm for more than one lesion

(some trials accept two lesions up to 4 cm); (2) without

radiographic evidence of extrahepatic disease or macro-

vascular invasion; and (3) occurring in the setting of

minimal or no portal hypertension and in the absence

of synthetic dysfunction (Barcelona Clinic Liver Can-

cer stage 0 or A). However, a number of clinical and

laboratory variables and circumstances, including the

availability of alternative therapies, can inﬂuence the

individual clinician’s decision to proceed with resec-

tion. The absence of a standard deﬁnition of resectabil-

ity constitutes a limitation of the interpretation of data

from analyses of studies comparing resection to abla-

tion of “resectable” tumors and may lead to biased

analyses and conclusions.

In addressing this particular question, it should be

noted that the existing evidence was reviewed to com-

pare resection with ablative therapy (also comparing

different ablative options) speciﬁcally to determine the

optimal therapeutic option for patients with early-stage

(T1-T2), potentially resectable HCC occurring in the

setting of compensated cirrhosis (minimal or no portal

hypertension and preserved synthetic function). Given

that liver transplantation is reserved for patients with

unresectable HCC, we did not include a review of

studies comparing transplantation to either resection

or ablative therapies.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The evidence proﬁle is included in Supporting

Table 3, which utilizes the data from a recent system-

atic review performed by Weis et al.(41) on treatment

for early-stage HCC in patients with Child-Pugh class

A or B cirrhosis. This systematic review did not cover

the use of TACE or TARE, though it covered multi-

ple other comparative groups—including RCTs com-

paring RFA with percutaneous ethanol or acetic acid

ablation—and found moderate quality evidence that

RFA prolonged survival. In both the RFA versus

resection comparison and the RFA versus other tech-

niques comparison, the authors of the systematic

review concluded that the total number of included

patients was too low to reach a ﬁrm conclusion.

Importantly, there were three RCTs that compared

RFA

with

resection,

including

a

total

of

578

patients.(42-44) Two of these three trials had a low risk

of bias and moderate evidence quality,(42,43) and one

trial had a high risk of bias.(44) The results of the two

low-risk-of-bias trials demonstrate that hepatic resec-

tion is more effective than RFA regarding overall sur-

vival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.78) as

well as 2-year survival (HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.84).

When a third trial with a high risk of bias is added to

the analysis, the difference in survival between resec-

tion and RFA became insigniﬁcant (overall survival:

HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.44-1.15). The reason for an

increased risk of bias in the third study is related to an

unusually high number of patients (n 5 19) who

switched from the RFA arm to the resection arm yet

were still counted within the RFA group because of

intention to treat, thus potentially overstating the ben-

eﬁt of RFA. The additional endpoints of 2-year event-

free survival and local progression favored resection

regardless of inclusion of the potentially biased trial.

Not unexpectedly, the complication rate was higher for

resection compared with RFA (OR, 8.3).

In addition to the trials included in the systematic

review by Weis et al.(41) comparing resection with

RFA, two recently published RCTs conﬁrm the ﬁnd-

ings of improved survival for patients after resec-

tion.(45,46) One single-center RCT compared resection

with RFA combined with TACE (TACE was per-

formed ﬁrst, followed by RFA within 4 weeks) and

demonstrated improved survival at 1, 3, and 5 years for

the resection group (P 5 0.007).(45) Another RCT tri-

al compared resection with TACE alone for lesions up

to and exceeding Milan criteria (up to ﬁve tumors,

with the largest being &lt;5 cm) and found resection to

be superior in 1 and 3 years of follow-up (HR, 0.4; P

&lt; 0.001).(46)

Lesion size was a risk factor for worse outcome in

both arms of the systematic review. This is not surpris-

ing given that it is known that RFA is more effective

in lesions &lt;3 cm. However, the speciﬁc question of

survival for patients with single HCC lesions &lt;3 cm

treated with resection versus RFA has not been

addressed in an RCT. A recent multicenter retrospec-

tive report from Italy did examine this question.(47)

This report included 544 Child-Pugh class A patients

from 15 centers, and the authors observed similar com-

plication rates (4.5% for resection, 2.0% for RFA; P 5

0.101), recurrence rates (56% for resection, 57.1% for

RFA; P 5 0.765), and 4-year survival rates (74.4% for

resection, 66.2% for RFA; P 5 0.353). A subgroup

analysis for outcomes of smaller single lesions was not

performed by Weis et al.,(41) but examining the three

individual RCT trials included in the systematic

HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 67, No. 1, 2018

HEIMBACH ET AL.

367


review, Huang et al.(42) demonstrated that survival fol-

lowing resection remained favorable compared with

RFA (P 5 0.03) in patients with smaller tumors. This

subgroup analysis was not performed in the other two

RCTs.

FUTURE RESEARCH

The comparative effectiveness of ablative strategies

other than RFA techniques, such as stereotactic body

radiation and microwave ablation, remain unclear. In

addition, the effectiveness of embolization strategies

such as transarterial approaches (TACE and TARE)

have not been systematically compared with either

resection or ablative strategies in Child-Pugh class A

patients with T1 or T2 HCC.

5. SHOULD ADULTS WITH

CIRRHOSIS AND HCC THAT HAS

BEEN RESECTED OR ABLATED

SUCCESSFULLY UNDERGO

ADJUVANT THERAPY?

Recommendation

5. The AASLD suggests against the routine use of

adjuvant therapy for patients with HCC following suc-

cessful resection or ablation.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. The modified Response Evaluation Criteria in

Solid Tumors (mRECIST) may be the most

common criteria used to evaluate radiological

response in patients affected by HCC and treated

with LRT, though other classification systems are

also used.(48)

2. The risk of recurrence after surgical resection or

ablation is related to characteristics of the tumor

at the time of surgery, such as size, degree of dif-

ferentiation, and the presence or absence of lym-

phovascular invasion.

BACKGROUND

Given the unique biology of HCC in which risk

includes both recurrence of the primary tumor and the

development of de novo tumors, the ideal adjuvant ther-

apy would have an antineoplastic component aimed at

the original tumor and a chemopreventive effect aimed

at the development of a de novo tumor. The distinction

of these two scenarios is difﬁcult and often based on the

time of the recurrence (e.g., early versus late, with the

latter believed to be related to the development of a de

novo tumor).(49) Early studies with the adjuvant use of

acyclic retinoids were promising,(50) with a decrease in

the development of secondary tumors, but larger studies

did not conﬁrm a beneﬁt.(51) The lack of proven active

agents in advanced disease has hampered the develop-

ment of agents targeting early-stage disease. To date,

most of the adjuvant agents studied did not have clinical

evidence that they improve survival in any stage of

HCC. Of the agents evaluated in the adjuvant setting,

only sorafenib has been shown to improve survival in

advanced disease,(52) yet it ultimately did not show any

improvement in outcomes for the adjuvant treatment of

HCC in randomized studies.(53) Resection of HCC

with curative intent or ablation is associated with rates

of recurrence at 5 years as high as 75%.(47) Therefore,

there is a clear need for adjuvant systemic therapies.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The evidence proﬁle is included in Supporting

Table 5, which uses the data from a recent systematic

review performed by Wang et al.(54) on adjuvant treat-

ment for HCC after treatment. The systematic review

by Wang et al. identiﬁed that adjuvant interferon ther-

apy can improve both recurrence-free and overall sur-

vival in patients with virus-associated liver disease;

however, the side effects of interferon are signiﬁcant,

limiting its use in clinical practice.(55) RCTs of adju-

vant chemotherapy, internal radiation, and heparanase

inhibitor PI-88 therapy were included in the systemat-

ic review and failed to improve recurrence-free or over-

all

survival.

The

efﬁcacy

of

several

cytotoxic

chemotherapy regimens has also been tested in RCTs

and has never been shown to improve survival in

advanced HCC,(56) which limits their use in the adju-

vant setting.

FUTURE RESEARCH

There is a clear need for the development of new,

effective chemotherapy agents for treatment of HCC

in both the advanced setting and in the adjuvant set-

ting. In addition, the impact of HCV eradication by

direct-acting antiviral therapies on the future risk of

HCC is uncertain and requires further study.(57) Final-

ly, the role of statin therapy in the adjuvant setting is

unknown, though it may warrant investigation given

the recent reports of an associated reduction in HCC

risk for patients with HBV who are on statin

therapy.(58)

6. SHOULD ADULTS WITH

CIRRHOSIS AWAITING LIVER

TRANSPLANTATION AND T1 HCC

BE TREATEDORUNDERGO

OBSERVATION?

Recommendation

6. The AASLD suggests observation with follow-up

imaging over treatment for patients with cirrhosis

awaiting liver transplantation who develop T1 HCC.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. This recommendation is intended for patients

who are already on the liver transplantation wait-

list—and thus presumably with an indication for

transplantation in addition to HCC—and is based

on current organ allocation policies in the United

States.

Future allocation

policy

revisions

may

impact this recommendation.

2. The choice of observation with follow-up imaging

versus

treatment

depends

on

several

factors

including patient preference, anticipated waiting

time, rate of growth of the lesion, degree of liver

decompensation, and AFP.

BACKGROUND

The decision to offer LRT consisting of either local

ablation or transarterial treatment to patients with cir-

rhosis who have a single HCC nodule between 1 and

2 cm (T1) and are listed for liver transplantation is

dependent in large part on an assessment of the

patient’s underlying liver function and ability to safely

undergo LRT, the anticipated wait time, and organ

allocation policy. In the United States, current liver

allocation policy prioritizes patients with OPTN T2

stage HCC (either a single lesion between 2-5 cm, or

2 or 3 lesions each between 1-3 cm) but not for those

with OPTN stage T1 (https://optn.transplant.hrsa.

gov/governance/policies). Therefore, if a T1 lesion is

treated with LRT, it may not reach stage T2, denying

the patient increased priority for transplantation.

LRT of a T1 HCC may be of signiﬁcant beneﬁt to

patients who are well compensated and have no other

indication for transplantation, as they may be able to

avoid transplantation. Importantly, the patient will

remain at risk for HCC recurrence and will require

continued monitoring. This is the outcome assessed

by the study by Huo et al.,(59) which is discussed

below.

If the patient has other indications for transplant

other than the presence of HCC, especially if these

complications are not captured by the current MELD-

Na score, such as encephalopathy or ascites, the deci-

sion to treat with LRT requires careful consideration.

If observation is contemplated, a key consideration is

the possibility that the tumor, if untreated, may grow

to beyond T2 criteria and/or metastasize during the

observation period. This is the question addressed in

the observational study by Mehta et al.,(60) which is

discussed below.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The data are summarized in Supporting Table 6,

including the ﬁndings of a de novo systematic review

of all studies that enrolled adults with cirrhosis

awaiting

liver

transplantation

and

treated

with

bridging or downstaging therapies before transplan-

tation. There were no RCTs. Eighty-seven noncom-

parative trials were identiﬁed, and only two of these

trials address the question of waitlist outcomes for

patients with T1 HCC who were or were not treated

with LRT.

The study by Mehta et al.(60) is a retrospective

observational study of 114 patients with T1 HCC

listed for liver transplantation at a single United States

institution between 2004-2012 who were not treated

with LRT. The median age was 60 years, with equal

proportions in Child-Pugh class A (48%) and Child-

Pugh class B/C (52%). The median follow-up was 2.4

years, and during the observation period, 100 patients

(87%) progressed from T1 to T2 at a median of 6.9

months. Six patients (5.3%) remained within T1, six

other patients (5.3%) progressed from T1 to beyond

T2 at a median of 5.1 months from listing, and two

additional patients died of non-HCC causes. The

cumulative probability of waitlist dropout was 4.5%

within 6 months, 7.1% within 1 year, and 15.6% with-

in 2 years, and the rate of tumor growth was estimated

to be 0.14 cm per month. Risks for wait list dropout

included AFP &gt;500 and rapid growth. The authors

HEPATOLOGY, Vol. 67, No. 1, 2018

HEIMBACH ET AL.

369


concluded that observation for patients with T1 HCC

waiting for liver transplantation is an acceptable strate-

gy, though based on their observations of the patients

who dropped out, they recommended LRT rather

than observation for patients with T1 HCC with high

AFP &gt;500 or with rapid growth. It is important to

note that this study was performed in an area with pro-

longed waiting time, and the ﬁndings may not be gen-

eralizable to areas with shorter wait times.

The study by Huo et al.(59) reported on outcomes

for 390 patients in Taiwan with T1 (n 5 94) and T2

(n 5 296) HCC who were eligible for transplantation

but who were treated instead with LRT. Patients were

treated with a number of different methods including

RFA, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) or acetic

acid injection, and TACE. Patients treated with RFA

had the lowest rate of waitlist dropout. Overall,

patients with T1 HCC had a 6-month waitlist dropout

rate of 5.3% for tumor progression beyond T2 criteria,

though this represented only 2% of patients treated

with RFA. Notably, a majority of patients in the study

had HBV and were of slightly older age than the typi-

cal transplantation patient, which may limit the gener-

alizability of the ﬁndings. In addition, the primary aim

of the study by Huo et al. was to validate a potential

allocation score proposal called the HCC-MELD

score rather than to observe the impact of LRT on

waitlisted patients with T1 or T2 HCC.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Additional

longitudinal

data

from

multicenter

cohorts of patients with T1 HCC would be beneﬁcial

to gain a better understanding of its natural history. In

addition, predictive markers of poor biologic behavior

such as rapid progression would also better inform

decisions about nontreatment of T1 HCC with regard

to a risk/beneﬁt analysis.

TRANSPLANTATION UNDERGO

TRANSPLANT ALONE OR

TRANSPLANT WITH BRIDGING

THERAPY WHILE WAITING?

Recommendations

7A. The AASLD suggests bridging to transplant in

patients listed for liver transplantation within OPTN

T2 (Milan) criteria to decrease progression of disease

and subsequent dropout from the waiting list.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

7B. The AASLD does not recommend one form of

liver-directed therapy over another for the purposes of

bridging to liver transplantation for patients within

OPTN T2 (Milan) criteria.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. Bridging is defined as the use of LRT—such as

TACE, yttrium-90 (Y90), ablative therapy, or a

combination of different types of LRT such as

TACE and ablation—to induce tumor death and

deter

tumor

progression

beyond

the

Milan

criteria.

2. The risk of hepatic decompensation due to LRT

must be considered when selecting patients for

bridging therapy.

3. Patients in the United States with HCC within

Milan criteria have been granted access to liver

transplantation by way of MELD exception point

allocation since February 2002. Although patients

with T2 HCC have continued to have access to

deceased

donor

liver

transplantation,

multiple

changes to the policy to reduce access combined

with ever-increasing waiting times have impacted

the interpretation of studies before and in the ear-

ly days following adoption of MELD allocation

compared with current practice.

4. Given that organ availability is variable, the prac-

tices for liver transplantation for HCC may differ

based on geographic location and access to living

and deceased donor organs.

5. The MELD allocation system with additional pri-

oritization for HCC is not practiced worldwide.

BACKGROUND

The primary aim of bridging therapy is to mini-

mize the risk of HCC progression while awaiting liv-

er

transplantation.

Patients

with

T2

tumors,

synonymous with the Milan criteria, have been

granted additional HCC MELD exception points

since 2002 because of an excellent overall survival

with a low risk for HCC recurrence posttransplanta-

tion (10%-15%).(61) Progression beyond the Milan

criteria while awaiting transplantation eliminates

access to exception points, and thus, maintaining

tumor burden within or below T2 while waiting for

transplantation is the only way to continue earning

exception points. Studies have demonstrated that

without liver-directed therapy, the dropout rate is as

high as 25% and 38% at 6 months and 12 months,

respectively.(62-64) This question assesses the beneﬁt

of the addition of bridging therapy for patients with

T2 HCC awaiting LT.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The data are summarized in Supporting Table 6,

including the ﬁndings of a de novo systematic review

of all studies that enrolled adults with cirrhosis await-

ing liver transplantation and treated with bridging or

downstaging therapies before transplantation. There

were 18 comparative studies that reported the out-

come of interest, though there were no RCTs. The

reported outcomes included dropout because of

HCC progression and because of all causes, recur-

rence rate, and overall recurrence-free survival after

liver transplantation. Among the comparative stud-

ies, one study enrolled only patients meeting Milan

criteria, six enrolled patients both within and exceed-

ing the Milan criteria, and two did not speciﬁcally

deﬁne criteria. The quality of the evidence overall

was very low because of studies with signiﬁcant risk

of bias and imprecision. The data were analyzed

using all included studies and among the subset of

those performed in the United States to control for

the MELD era effect. This stratiﬁcation did not

reveal any signiﬁcant difference among the various

outcomes. Importantly, there was a trend toward

lower dropout because of progression and lower

dropout from all causes in patients who received

bridging LRT (relative risk [RR], 0.32 and 0.38,

respectively), but the difference did not reach statisti-

cal signiﬁcance. Posttransplantation recurrence and

survival rates were not signiﬁcantly different between

the two reported cohorts, despite the lack of random-

ization and potential for selection bias regarding

which patients were selected to receive bridging.

Outcomes were noted to be similar when examined

by TACE, transarterial embolization (TAE), RFA,

TACE 1 RFA, or multitherapies. The RR of recur-

rence was &lt;1 in patients treated with TACE 1 RFA

and RFA alone with a markedly wide CI and was

limited to single studies with relatively small num-

bers in each respective therapy. Despite this limited

evidence,

bridging

therapy

is

conditionally

recommended because of selection bias for the

patients selected to receive LRT as well as shorter

waiting time during the study period compared with

the present time and the relatively low risk of harm

for the intervention compared with the potential

beneﬁt. Noncomparative studies of LRT have been

associated with lower rates of waitlist dropout of

8.7% at 6 months and 22.9% at and 12 months,

respectively.(65) Furthermore, 3-year overall survival

(OS) after liver transplantation has been reported to

be signiﬁcantly improved in patients with HCC who

received LRT compared with those who did not

using the Scientiﬁc Registry Transplant Recipients

data: 76% versus 71% (P 5 0.03).(66) The decision to

bridge patients with HCC to transplantation is large-

ly dependent upon their anticipated waiting time,

with those exceeding 6 months being considered for

LRT if deemed appropriate based on the degree of

hepatic dysfunction.(67)

FUTURE RESEARCH

An RCT comparing bridging LRT versus not

receiving bridging LRT for waitlisted patients with

HCC is unlikely to be performed due primarily to

logistical reasons, including geographically variable

wait time within the United States for deceased donor

transplants in patients with HCC. Greater attention to

stratifying

outcomes

based

on

pretransplantation

radiographic response using mRECIST may help to

delineate the true potential beneﬁt derived from LRT.

The addition of biomarker data may also help stratify

HCC with regard to its biologic behavior and response

to LRT.

CIRRHOSIS AND HCC BEYOND

MILAN CRITERIA (T3) BE

TRANSPLANTED FOLLOWING

DOWNSTAGING TO WITHIN

MILAN CRITERIA?

Recommendation

8. The AASLD suggests that patients beyond the

Milan criteria (T3) should be considered for liver trans-

plantation after successful downstaging into the Milan

criteria.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very Low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. The optimal form of liver-directed therapy for the

purposes of downstaging cannot be determined

based on the available data.

2. Currently, in the United States, MELD exception

may be granted by appeal to the regional review

board system for patients initially presenting with

T3 HCC after successful down-staging to within

T2/Milan criteria, or they may appeal with a T3

tumor, though this is not a practice that is widely

accepted. HCC organ allocation policy may be

revised in the future to allow access to standard-

ized MELD exception for down-staged patients

rather than requiring appeal.

3. There is no standard, agreed-upon waiting period

following down-staging to determine efficacy of

down-staging and subsequent optimal timing for

liver transplantation.

4. Many studies define down-staging as a reduction

in tumor burden to within Milan criteria based on

radiographic findings, though some studies define

down-staging as a complete absence of tumor by

radiographic findings. Other studies use explant

pathology

to

define

successful

down-staging,

which is not useful in patient selection and makes

direct comparison of results challenging.

BACKGROUND

Down-staging is deﬁned as a reduction in tumor

burden to predeﬁned criteria, most commonly the

Milan criteria, through the use of LRT. Although

some may consider the Milan criteria to be too restric-

tive, the severe organ shortage and concerns about

futility support limiting access to organs to patients

within these criteria. Within the United States,

patients who exceed these criteria who can be success-

fully down-staged to within the Milan criteria may

become eligible for HCC MELD exception points

after undergoing review by their respective regional

review board. Reported success with down-staging is

highly variable (24%-90%).(68) This variability is large-

ly because of differences in tumor burden before LRT,

type of LRT used, deﬁnition of successful down-

staging, as well as differing methods to assess radio-

graphic response (WHO, EASL, RECIST, mRE-

CIST) and lack of a standardized time period at which

response to therapy is gauged. Furthermore, some have

proposed the incorporation of tumor markers in

addition to tumor size and number to meet criteria for

successful down-staging. This key question attempts

to determine whether patients with HCC burden

beyond Milan criteria should undergo liver transplan-

tation after successful down-staging to within Milan

criteria.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The data are summarized in Supporting Table 6,

including the ﬁndings of a de novo systematic review of

all studies that enrolled adults with cirrhosis awaiting

liver transplantation and treated them with bridging or

down-staging therapies before transplantation. There

were a total of 24 studies examined for outcomes asso-

ciated with down-staging and transplantation; there

were no RCTs. Only three of these studies compared

down-staging of T3 tumors versus T2 tumors with no

down-staging before liver transplantation, whereas the

remaining studies were noncomparative, as summa-

rized in Supporting Table 6. There were no compara-

tive studies for transplantation of T3 with and without

down-staging. The outcomes reported in the three

comparative studies were limited to post–liver trans-

plantation overall (1, 3, and 5 years) and recurrence-

free survival (1 and 5 years). Down-staging of T3

patients compared with no therapy (in T2 patients)

before liver transplantation was associated with similar

overall

and

recurrence-free

survival.

The

5-year

observed survival with down-staging had an RR of

1.17 (95% CI, 1.03-1.32), relative to no down-staging.

Heckman et al.(69) provided the only comparative yet

nonrandomized United States study, which includes

123 patients undergoing transplantation between 2000

and 2006, spanning both pre- and post-MELD era

patients. In this series, patients had a very short wait list

time: 28 days in the 50 patients receiving LRT (TACE,

Y90, RFA, or resection) before transplantation and 24

days in those without LRT before transplantation.

There were 12 of 50 patients who were successfully

down-staged from T3 to within T2 at the time of trans-

plantation. No signiﬁcant difference in OS was noted

between the 12 that were down-staged compared with

the remaining patients in the LRT group, most of

whom were stage T2 at the time of transplantation.

Hoł�owko et al.(70) present outcomes for patients

reported to be beyond T2 treated with LRT, compared

with those within T2 who were not treated with LRT,

noting no difference in 5-year OS. The third compara-

tive study was from Asia and consisted predominately of

living donor liver transplantations, with down-staging

HEIMBACH ET AL.

HEPATOLOGY, January 2018

372


consisting mostly of TACE.(71) A total of 51 T3

patients were successfully down-staged radiographically

to the Milan criteria and were compared with 110

patients who presented within Milan criteria and thus

underwent LT without LRT. A small number of T3

patients underwent resection for down-staging. There

was a trend favoring LRT for both OS and RFS, despite

the down-staged patients being at a more advanced

stage, though these differences did not reach signiﬁcance

(OS 83.7% versus 78.9%; RFS 90% versus 86%).

The majority of the remaining studies that examined

down-staging were noncomparative studies. Among the

21 noncomparative studies, 14 reported recurrence rates

posttransplantation that averaged 20.4% (CI 0.15-27.7),

with the lowest recurrence rate noted to be in studies that

employed multitherapies. Overall, the 5-year post LT

OS was 77.6%. These outcomes are comparable to what

has been reported posttransplantataion among patients

with HCC within Milan criteria. The number of studies

that examined various individual modalities (including

Y90, drug-eluting beads TACE [DEB-TACE], PEI,

RFA, TACE, transarterial chemoinfusion [TACI], and

TAE) were small, with a range of 1-4 for each modality.

The highest 5-year OS was reported in those treated

with multitherapies (84.4%), and the lowest 5-year OS

was seen in those that were treated with TACI (54.1%).

A lack of a comparative group beyond historical controls

severely limits interpretation. Noncomparative studies

examining the success of down-staging may include

patients who are not deemed liver transplant candidates

for other reasons (e.g., advanced age or signiﬁcant

comorbidities), and thus the results of these studies may

be affected by the inclusion of nontransplant candidates

in whom LRT is palliative in its intent.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Determining the variables which predict outcomes

after down-staging as well as the optimal waiting period

between down-staging and transplantation are key tar-

gets for future studies. Effectiveness of down-staging

before transplantation can only be determined if the

many variables that can confound these analyses are stan-

dardized, and Parikh et al.(72) have proposed criteria that

should be included in all down-staging studies, including

patient demographics, center characteristics such as vol-

ume and waiting time, tumor characteristics such as Bar-

celona Clinic Liver Cancer stage, treatment details, and

posttransplant details such as recurrence and survival.

9. SHOULD ADULTS WITH

CIRRHOSIS AND HCC (T2 OR T3,

NO VASCULAR INVOLVEMENT)

WHO ARE NOT CANDIDATES

FOR RESECTION OR

TRANSPLANTATION BE

TREATED WITH TACE, TARE, OR

EXTERNAL RADIATION?

Recommendations

9A. The AASLD recommends LRT over no treat-

ment in adults with cirrhosis and HCC (T2 or T3, no

vascular involvement) who are not candidates for resec-

tion or transplantation.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence:

TACE: Moderate

Transarterial Bland Embolization: Very Low

TARE: Very Low

External Radiation: Very Low

Strength of Recommendation: Strong

9B. The AASLD does not recommend one form of

LRT over another.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Very low

Strength of Recommendation: Conditional

Technical Remarks

1. The available evidence is for Child-Pugh class A

and highly selected Child-Pugh class B. There are

no data to support the use of LRT for patients

with Child-Pugh class C or poor performance sta-

tus, and use of LRT should be weighed against

the risk of harm.

2. The data for the use of TARE and external beam

radiotherapy is emerging. As discussed below, the

results to date are encouraging but inadequate to

make a recommendation.

3. RFA is another treatment strategy that may be

used for selected patients with unresectable T2

HCC, depending on the size, location, and num-

ber of lesions.

BACKGROUND

TACE and bland TAE are widely used in patients

with unresectable HCC, either as bridge to transplan-

tation or as a recommended treatment to extend sur-

vival in the setting of patients with HCC not

amenable to either resection or transplantation. More

recently, with advances in technology to improve preci-

sion, external beam radiotherapy and TARE have also

been used as a treatment strategy for HCC. The intent

of this question was to review the existing evidence to

attempt to determine the optimal therapy for those

patients with larger (&gt;2.5 cm) or multinodular T2 or

T3 tumors with no evidence of distant metastasis or

macrovascular invasion who are not eligible for resec-

tion or liver transplantation.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The data used for this question are based on recent

existing systematic reviews. A meta-analysis performed

by Llovet and Bruix(73) comparing TACE with placebo

identiﬁed seven RCTs on TACE versus placebo with a

total of 545 patients, establishing TACE as an effective

strategy for unresectable multinodular HCC occurring in

patients with compensated cirrhosis. The analysis dem-

onstrated improvement in 2-year survival for patients

treated with TACE versus placebo (41% versus 27%;

OR, 0.53; P 5 0.017.) However, Oliveri et al.(74) per-

formed a more recent systematic review that questioned

the beneﬁcial effect of TACE. In this report, TACE or

TAE were compared with placebo for T2 or T3 HCC

not amenable to resection or transplantation. The prima-

ry outcome was all-cause mortality, with secondary out-

comes of tumor response, adverse events, and quality of

life also included. In this analysis, there were nine RCTs

identiﬁed on the use of TACE (six RCTs) or TAE

(three RCTs), published between 1990 and 2005,

reporting on a total of 645 patients.(75-84) Compared

with the meta-analysis by Llovet and Bruix, there were

two additional RCTs included.(75,77) Of the nine includ-

ed trials, 2 were noted to have a high risk of bias. Analy-

sis of the HRs from seven trials with low risk of bias

showed no signiﬁcant effect of TACE or TAE com-

pared with placebo on survival (overall HR, 0.88; 95%

CI, 0.71-1.10; P 5 0.27), though the data from TACE

were pooled with the data from TAE. The two trials

with high risk of bias showed a signiﬁcant effect (HR,

0.53; 95% CI, 0.34-0.83; P 5 0.005). When all nine tri-

als were analyzed together for overall mortality, no signif-

icant intervention effect (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64-1.02;

P 5 0.07) was noted. Notably, a subgroup analysis of

TACE only was performed, and this still failed to dem-

onstrate a statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt to TACE (HR,

0.79; 95% CI, 0.58-1.06; P 5 0.11). The authors calcu-

lated the number of subjects required to be included in a

meta-analysis to accept or reject an intervention effect at

1028, and therefore only about two-thirds of the required

number of study subjects were available to be included in

the analysis. Looking at the overall outcomes for the

more recent trials of TACE only versus TACE plus an

ablative strategy without a placebo control arm, the over-

all survival for the TACE-only groups in these studies is

superior to the TACE-only groups from the earlier stud-

ies, suggesting that reﬁnements in techniques may have

had an impact on outcomes following TACE alone.

A

meta-analysis

speciﬁcally

comparing

DEB-

TACE with conventional TACE treatment performed

by Facciorusso et al.(85) identiﬁed four RCTs and eight

observational trials. Nonsigniﬁcant trends were noted

in 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival in favor of DEB-TACE

compared with conventional TACE. Pooled analysis

of objective response and of complications showed no

difference between the two therapies.

Abdel-Rahman and Elsayed(86) performed a systematic

review to determine the potential beneﬁt of TARE using

Y90 microsphere radioembolization. In this analysis, two

RCTs were identiﬁed with a total of 64 patients. One of

the trials compared TARE with TACE for intermediate-

stage HCC, whereas the other was a planned interim

analysis of TARE plus sorafenib versus sorafenib alone

for advanced stage cancer, which is not the population

addressed in this question. Neither trial reported on mor-

tality or disease progression. Both trials were classiﬁed as

having a high risk of bias and low quality. Both trials

demonstrated a similar adverse event frequency in each

arm. Looking speciﬁcally at the Kolligs et al.(87) trial for

TARE versus TACE, there were a total of 28 patients

included, with 13 patients treated with TARE and 15

treated with TACE. There were two patients in each arm

who were successfully down-staged to either undergo liver

transplantation (n 5 3) or RFA (n 5 1). Though the cur-

rent data are too sparse to make an assessment of efﬁcacy,

the authors identiﬁed ﬁve ongoing trials, so additional

data is anticipated in the near future. Importantly, a

single-center RCT comparing TARE with TACE per-

formed at a United States transplantation center has just

been reported and has demonstrated longer time to pro-

gression for waitlisted patients with HCC receiving

TARE compared with TACE.(88) This trial was not ade-

quately powered to detect a survival advantage.

An additional meta-analysis of trials performed pri-

marily in China published in 2015 assessed the avail-

able data for the combination of TACE plus PEI

compared with TACE alone for T2 and T3 unresect-

able tumors and identiﬁed 19 RCTs that met this

inclusion criterion.(89) This analysis included 1948

patients and found a beneﬁt to the combination of

TACE and PEI in both survival at 1 and 2 years as

HEIMBACH ET AL.

HEPATOLOGY, January 2018

well as in local tumor response rates and decreased

AFP values. The patients who beneﬁted the most from

the combination therapy were those with preserved liv-

er function. There was heterogeneity in the included

studies, and although the authors concluded that com-

bination therapy appears to be beneﬁcial compared

with TACE alone, further multicenter RCTs are clear-

ly needed. Another meta-analysis of trials of TACE

alone versus TACE plus external beam radiotherapy

has also been performed by Huo and Eslick that

included 11 RCT and 25 trials overall.(90) This analysis

demonstrated signiﬁcant beneﬁt to the combination

therapy for OS at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years posttreatment as

well as for local tumor control. The RCTs analyzed in

this trial were all from Asian centers, and the eligibility

criteria were variable among the studies. It is unknown

whether RFA or PEI would be equivalent to external

beam radiotherapy in combination with TACE.

FUTURE RESEARCH

Additional data on the efﬁcacy of TARE and external

beam radiotherapy is anticipated in the near future.

Efforts will likely need to focus on deﬁning which patient

characteristics (tumor number, location, size, underlying

liver disease, and degree of liver dysfunction) are most

important in determining efﬁcacy of therapy. Patient fac-

tors may also determine which patients may beneﬁt from

combination therapy of TACE or TARE plus an ablative

strategy and which ablative strategy should be used.

10. SHOULD ADULTS WITH

CHILD-PUGH CLASS A/B

CIRRHOSIS AND ADVANCED HCC

WITH MACROVASCULAR

INVASION AND/OR METASTATIC

DISEASE BE TREATED WITH

SYSTEMIC THERAPY OR LRT OR

NO THERAPY?

Recommendation

10. The AASLD recommends the use of systemic

therapy over no therapy for patients with Child-Pugh

class A cirrhosis or well-selected patients with Child-

Pugh class B cirrhosis plus advanced HCC with macro-

vascular invasion and/or metastatic disease.

Quality/Certainty of Evidence: Moderate

Strength of Recommendation: Strong

Technical Remarks

1. It was not possible to make a recommendation for

systemic therapy over LRT, because there was

inadequate evidence to inform the balance of ben-

efit versus harm.

2. Advanced HCC is a heterogeneous group. The

selection of treatment type may vary depending

on the extent of macrovascular invasion and/or

metastatic disease, the degree of underlying cir-

rhosis, and patient’s performance status, and when

patients have very poor performance status and/or

advanced cirrhosis, no therapy may be the best

option.

3. It is not possible to identify a preferred type of

LRT based on the available evidence.

4. Most patients involved in the studies had Child-

Pugh class A cirrhosis, although studies were

mixed and included some patients with Child-

Pugh class B cirrhosis.

BACKGROUND

Patients with advanced HCC (macrovascular inva-

sion and/or metastatic disease) represent a unique clin-

ical challenge. The prognosis and treatment decision is

generally dependent on the extent of the vascular inva-

sion and/or metastatic disease, the severity of underly-

ing cirrhosis, and the performance status of the

patient. Even for patients with metastatic disease, par-

ticularly those with limited extrahepatic tumor burden,

the presence of concurrent macrovascular invasion

often leads to rapid tumor progression with disease-

related symptoms. Therefore, many patients with lim-

ited extrahepatic metastatic disease burden and concur-

rent macrovascular vascular invasion have been treated

with LRT. While various LRTs are provided in this

setting, the evidence supporting the routine use of

many of these approaches has not been established,

and thus far, regardless of the treatment strategy used,

the prognosis remains poor.

The intent of this question was to review the existing

evidence to determine the optimal treatment recommen-

dation for those patients with advanced HCC (macro-

vascular invasion and/or metastatic disease) in the setting

of underlying Child-Pugh class A/B cirrhosis.

EVIDENCE AND RATIONALE

The evidence of a de novo systematic review includ-

ing all studies that enrolled adults with advanced HCC

is summarized in Supporting Table 7. Of the 15 stud-

ies identiﬁed, four were RCTs, and the other 11 were

observational studies. The four RCTs were not

designed to compare the outcome of sorafenib with

LRT in advanced HCC. There were no comparative

trials and only a few noncomparative studies that

addressed the question of whether patients should be

treated with either sorafenib or LRT. The only level-

one evidence that exists in patients with advanced

HCC (macrovascular invasion and/or metastatic dis-

ease) is a randomized phase 3 trial with sorafenib in

comparison with placebo. In the pivotal SHARP trial,

of the total 602 patients enrolled, 231 patients had

macrovascular invasion and 309 patients had extrahe-

patic metastasis. In the sorafenib arm, there were 108

patients (35%) with macrovascular invasion versus the

placebo arm, which had 123 patients (41%) with mac-

rovascular invasion. Additionally, in the sorafenib arm,

159 patients (53%) had extrahepatic disease versus the

placebo arm, which had 150 patients (50%) with extra-

hepatic disease. Of note, the extent of macrovascular

invasion was not detailed, and the extent of metastatic

disease was only provided for lungs and lymph nodes.

Sorafenib signiﬁcantly improved the median OS in the

entire population included in the study (sorafenib, 10.7

months versus placebo, 7.9 months; HR, 0.69; 95%

CI, 0.55-0.87) and demonstrated a trend for improve-

ment both for patients with macrovascular invasion

(sorafenib, 8.1 months versus placebo, 4.9 months;

HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.93) and for patients with

metastatic disease (sorafenib, 8.9 months versus place-

bo, 8.3 months; HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.64-1.15).(52,91)

Similarly, in the Asia-Paciﬁc phase 3 trial, of the

226 patients randomized, 80 (35%) patients had mac-

rovascular invasion and 155 (69%) patients had extra-

hepatic disease. Sorafenib signiﬁcantly improved the

median OS in comparison with placebo in the whole

study population (sorafenib, 6.5 months versus place-

bo, 4.2 months; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50-0.93) and

demonstrated a positive trend in both patients with

macrovascular invasion (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.39-1.03)

and with metastatic disease to either lungs or lymph

nodes (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57-1.18).(92,93)

The deﬁnitive beneﬁts of sorafenib in advanced

HCC with underlying Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis

has not been clearly established, though an ongoing

randomized phase 3 trial conducted in Italy is evaluat-

ing sorafenib versus placebo in patients with advanced

HCC

and

underlying

Child-Pugh

B

cirrhosis

(NCT01405573). There have been four published

phase 3 randomized trials comparing sorafenib versus

either other targeted agents (sunitinib, brivanib, linifa-

nib) or the combination of sorafenib with erloti-

nib.(92,94,95) Collectively, there were an additional

2001 patients enrolled in the sorafenib arm, with 688

patients with macrovascular invasion and 1220 patients

with metastatic disease, reinforcing the beneﬁts of sor-

afenib in advanced HCC. No RCTs have been pub-

lished to critically assess the relative beneﬁts of

sorafenib versus LRT in advanced HCC with either

macrovascular invasion or metastatic disease.

Speciﬁc to patients with macrovascular disease, one

single-center retrospective observational study (N 5

557) has attempted to compare the relative beneﬁts of

TACE alone (n 5 295) or TACE with radiation (n 5

196) with sorafenib (n 5 66) in patients with advanced

HCC with portal vein thrombosis (PVT).(96) The

TACE/radiation group had longer median time to

progression and OS than the chemoembolization alone

and sorafenib groups (P &lt; 0.001). In an observational

retrospective study, Nakazawa et al.(97) compared the

survival beneﬁts of sorafenib versus radiation in

patients with advanced HCC with PVT in the main

trunk or its ﬁrst branch. Of the 97 patients included,

40 received sorafenib and 57 received radiation. Medi-

an survival did not differ signiﬁcantly between the sor-

afenib group (4.3 months) and the radiation group (5.9

months; P 5 0.115). In another retrospective observa-

tional study, Song et al.(98) compared the efﬁcacy of

hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC)—

which involves an actual infusion catheter directly in

the hepatic artery as opposed to embolized particles

mixed with chemotherapy released in the artery—with

sorafenib in advanced HCC with PVT. The median

OS was signiﬁcantly longer in the HAIC group than

in the sorafenib group (7.1 versus 5.5 months; P 5

0.011).

FUTURE RESEARCH

Given the recognized poor prognosis for patients

with advanced HCC with macrovascular invasion,

clinical trials with combined strategies using sorafenib

and LRT are ongoing. Two phase 3 trials are compar-

ing the survival beneﬁts of sorafenib versus radioembo-

lization

in

advanced

HCC

with

macrovascular

invasion (NCT01135056, NCT01482442). In addi-

tion, the added beneﬁts of LRT (radiation, TACE,

and HAIC) combined with sorafenib versus sorafenib

alone is being studied in ongoing phase 3 clinical trials

(NCT01730937,

NCT01829035,

NCT02774187,

and NCT01214343). For patients with metastatic

disease, there is an attempt to assess the added beneﬁts

of stereotactic body radiation to sorafenib (RTOG

1112) through a randomized phase 3 trial comparing

sorafenib with or without stereotactic body radiation in

patients with advanced HCC (NCT01730937). Phase

3 trials comparing lenvatinib or nivolumab with sorafe-

nib are ongoing in an attempt to improve survival in

patients who have advanced HCC with metastatic dis-

ease (NCT01761266 and NCT02576509).
