Hepatitis B Management:  

Guidance for the Primary Care Provider 

Last updated February 25, 2020 

The purpose of this document is to provide simplified, 

up-to-date, and readily accessible guidance for primary care 

medical providers related to the prevention, diagnosis, and 

management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, including 

hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance. 

About the HBV Primary Care Workgroup 

This guidance was developed by the Hepatitis B Primary Care 

Workgroup, a multidisciplinary panel of national experts in the field of 

viral hepatitis B, including representation from hepatology, infectious 

diseases, pharmacy, primary care, public health, and other national 

organizations. The workgroup was organized by the National Taskforce 

on Hepatitis B in partnership with the San Francisco Hep B Free — Bay 

Area and Project ECHO™ and did not receive any outside funding. 

Collaboration with University of Washington 

This guidance was produced in collaboration with the University of 

Washington’s National Hepatitis Training Center (HTC). The UW HTC will 

host and feature the most current version of these guidelines on the free 

Hepatitis B Online website (hepatitisB.uw.edu). The UW HTC is funded by 

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

1 Do not include anti-HBc IgM in HBV screening panel unless suspect acute HBV. 

1 Occult HBV infection is defined by the presence of detectable HBV DNA in persons who are negative for HBsAg. Patients with occult 

HBV infection should be managed similarly to those with current infection, but note that most have very low HBV DNA levels and do 

not need HBV treatment.  

2 Consider HBV vaccination for persons with no known risk factors or persons not from an area of intermediate or high endemicity 

as this may represent a false-positive anti-HBc result. The rate of false positive anti-HBc is less than 2 per 1,000 tests using 

current assays. 

3 For “susceptible” persons considered at high risk for HBV who previously received a complete vaccine series without follow-up 

serologic testing, acceptable management options include (a) give a booster vaccine dose followed by serologic testing 1 to 2 months 

later, with completion of a full vaccine series if the post-booster anti-HBs test remains negative or (b) give full vaccine series followed 

by post-vaccination serologic testing 1 to 2 months after the last vaccine dose. 

1 APRI and FIB-4 scores can be calculated using platelet count and AST and ALT from routine labs. Calculators with score interpretation 

are available. See Hepatitis B Online APRI calculator and FIB-4 calculator. FibroSure and FibroTest are commercially available blood 

tests that can be ordered as well. 

Counseling of the HBsAg(+) Patient 

1.  Give a plan for follow-up care. Patients will need regular (minimum every 6 months) follow-up and 

monitoring for disease progression.  

2.  Educate and counsel on the long-term implications of chronic HBV infection (e.g., cirrhosis and 

hepatocellular carcinoma).  

3.  Advise patient to inform all current and future medical providers of their HBsAg-positive status, 

especially if they ever need treatment for cancer or any immunologic condition such as rheumatoid 

arthritis or other immune disorders. 

4.  Counsel to avoid or limit alcohol use.  

5.  Advise to optimize body weight and address metabolic complications, including control of diabetes 

and dyslipidemia (to prevent concurrent development of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver). 

6.  Provide education on how to prevent transmission of HBV to others.  

1 In contrast to other HBV guidelines that have incorporated HBeAg status into treatment initiation decisions for non-cirrhotic HBsAg(+) 

patients, this guidance for primary care providers uses only HBV DNA and ALT to determine initial treatment indication in non-

cirrhotic HBsAg(+) patients.  

2 Patients should be considered to have decompensated cirrhosis and promptly referred to a hepatologist if any of the following are 

present: jaundice, ascites, variceal hemorrhage, hepatic encephalopathy, or a Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score ≥7 (see Hepatitis B 

Online CTP calculator. 

3 Elevated ALT defined as <25 U/L in females and <35 U/L in males that is persistent for at least 3 to 6 months. 
 
Assessing Treatment Response and Endpoints for Antiviral Discontinuation 

After initiation of HBV antiviral, recheck HBV DNA every 3 months until undetectable, then every 

6 months once undetectable. If the patient does not achieve undetectable HBV DNA after 1 year of 

antiviral therapy and the HBV DNA levels are not downtrending, obtain expert consultation or refer 

to a specialist.  

< Persons with cirrhosis: Do not stop antiviral treatment, unless guided by expert consultation. 

< Persons without cirrhosis and HBeAg(+) at baseline: Patients with persistent undetectable HBV 

DNA, normal ALT, and persistent HBeAg(-) and anti-HBe(+) 1 year after HBeAg seroconversion 

[from HBeAg(+)/anti-HBe(-) to HBeAg(-)/anti-HBe(+)] may trial off antiviral treatment. 

< Persons without cirrhosis and HBeAg(-) at baseline: Continue antiviral treatment until HBsAg 

clearance. 

1 In 2015, the US FDA replaced the pregnancy risk designation by letters A, B, C, D, and X with more specific language on pregnancy and 

lactation. This new labeling is being phased in gradually and, to date, only tenofovir alafenamide includes these additional data.  

2 Decompensated liver disease defined as Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) ≥7 (see Hepatitis B Online CTP calculator). 

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Surveillance 

Indications for HCC Surveillance 

Persons with chronic HBV at increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who require routine 

surveillance include:  

< All persons with cirrhosis, including persons who become HBsAg(-) 

< The following populations, even in the absence of cirrhosis: 

 Asian or black/African1 males older than 40 years of age 

 Asian females older than 50 years of age 

 Persons with a family history of HCC  

 Persons with hepatitis D virus coinfection 

Recommended HCC Surveillance Method 

HCC surveillance should be performed in the primary care setting with liver ultrasound with or without 

serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)2 every 6 months. More frequent monitoring or other imaging modalities 

such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with and without contrast, may 

be indicated to further evaluate new liver lesions.  

1 More recent African immigrants may be at increased risk for HCC and some experts begin HCC surveillance at age <40 years. 

2 Wait at least 6 months after pregnancy before using AFP for HCC surveillance.  

1 All pregnant women should be screened for HBV (with HBsAg at minimum) during each pregnancy, regardless of prior HBV screening 

results. For complete HBV profile, add anti-HBs to determine immunity and anti-HBc IgG or total for evidence of prior infection. 

2 All HBsAg(+) mothers should be educated on the importance of regular follow-up during and after the pregnancy so that appropriate 

HBV monitoring can occur. 

3 Engerix-B and Recombivax-HB are safe to give at any time during pregnancy. Due to insufficient data, Heplisav-B vaccine is not 

recommended during pregnancy. 

4 If an HBsAg(+) woman is already on antiviral therapy when she becomes pregnant, the antiviral regimen should immediately be 

switched to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (if she is not already taking this medication). 

5 For infants weighing less than 2,000 grams, the birth dose does not count toward the vaccine series and the infant should receive 

another HBV vaccine one month after birth.


ALL infants of HBsAg(-) women should: 

< Receive birth dose HBV vaccine within 

24 hours of birth 

ALL infants of HBsAg(+) women should: 

< Receive birth dose HBV vaccine and 

HBIG within 12 hours of birth 

< Complete HBV vaccine series on 

schedule5 

< Receive a post-vaccination serology 

test at 9 to 12 months of age with 

HBsAg and anti-HBs to assess for 

mother-to-child transmission and 

confirm immunity 

Abbreviations 

MTCT – mother-to-child transmission 

TDF – tenofovir disoproxil fumarate  

HBIG – hepatitis B immune globuline


HBV and Breastfeeding 

All HBsAg(+) mothers, including those on TDF, 

should be educated on the value and safety of 

breastfeeding and that HBV is not transmitted 

through breastmilk.  

Breastfeeding mothers with cracked nipples 

should practice proper nipple care and be 

informed that HBV vaccination and HBIG will 

protect against transmission from such blood 

exposures.
